11,"An Explainer on the True Cost of ""No Cost"" EMI Card Payments",248,joh250,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/joh250/an_explainer_on_the_true_cost_of_no_cost_emi_card/,55,1604603714.0,"This festive season, I finally had a lot of  purchasing backlog and most of it ended up with good discounts. Coupled  with great bank offers I bought it all, saving a substantial sum of  money. While I was seeing all these ""No Cost"" EMI offers on online  shopping portals since years, I never gave them a thought because 1.) I  never remotely needed them, and 2.) I am distrustful of any mechanism  which enables people to shop unnecessary things beyond their means. This  time around the figure was substantial, and for the first time paying  it upfront in the next cycle meant I'd have little liquid balance in my  account. Nothing I couldn't manage, but I thought to myself, if for no  additional cost I can split this into 3 payments - why the hell not try  it?

And thus I popped my Credit Card EMI cherry. I did the math several  times before payment - yes, the final amount I would be paying (EMIs x 3  months) was exactly the same as my current cart value. (There was one  item attracting a little interest that was explicitly not covered by the  scheme, which I didn't mind shelling out, so I will ignore that for  this discussion.) In case you do not know, here's a brief on how it  works. No one can give you a 0% interest loan as per RBI norms, so No  Cost EMI is not a 0% rate loan. Then how do the total payments match the  exact value of upfront payment? What they do is that a special discount  is applied on the bill IF you choose to pay the EMI way (which is borne  by the bank but also partially by the merchant). This discount is such  that when the standard EMI calculation with 15% interest is done, the  sum of EMIs is the same as the actual bill amount. I'll illustrate the  numbers for a 6 month EMI conversion on a bill of Rs. 10,000:

Upfront Payment = Rs. 10,000

No Cost EMI discount = Rs. 429

Net Principal = Rs. 9,571

EMI for 6 months @ 15% = Rs. 1667

Total EMI Payment = Rs. 10,002

Pretty neat, and a clear win for you, huh? Not so fast, Mojo Jojo.

Any EMI loan creation charges your card with a Rs. 199 fee, +18% GST -  that's Rs. 235. Since you've converted a Rs. 10,000 purchase into EMI,  you've already spent an extra 2.35%. Next up, card purchases made with  EMI structure do not earn any points. Even the most basic of credit  cards provide points worth 0.7% to 0.9% of purchase value. Now, let's  get to the fun part. Just like creation of EMI loan, every payment of  EMI interest is also considered a service and thus attracts 18% GST.  Yes, you read that right - the entire interest portion (= EMI discount)  is taxed at 18%, which turns out to be Rs. 77 here, so another 0.77%. On  the net, that's around 4% of your value that you are going to be paying  extra.

I am aware that 4% of product value does not seem too much of a cost  for financing Rs. 10,000 over 6 months, especially in absolute terms.  But fact remains that it is not ""No Cost"" in the true sense of the word.  Bump this up to Rs. 1 Lakh and the fees, lost points and taxes add up  to about 2% of bill amount, or Rs. 2,000. It is not a small amount by  any means, and you would be burning into some of the discounts which  made you get into the deals in the first place. It is a shitty practice  on the part of the banks/card issuers and I felt this needed a  descriptive analysis. I searched and searched before signing up for  this, and all I found out about was the Rs. 199 fees - the lost points  and GST on interested was a complete surprise for me.

Again, I'm not bashing or regretting the deal, as it is a convenience  and a ""not bad"" deal for financing when in a pinch and something you  need is on a great deal. My point is that there's quite a bit of hidden  charges you'd end up paying and banks find it in their interest to not  show these explicitly in an accessible way, presumably to get people to  buy shit they don't need using money they haven't earned yet. If you're  one of those people, do reconsider your decision.

Edit: I might have jumped the gun assuming all banks levied the 199 charge - as I have learnt that many banks do not. So that bit might be specific to my case, i.e., HDFC Bank.",False,Business/Finance,"I'm glad you noticed this, reminds me of something similar that real estate companies do.

In 1987, a move by Manu Chhabria to pick up a one per cent stake in Larsen & Toubro (L&T) triggered multiple controversies that ended only 16 years later in 2003, after many riveting political and boardroom dramas. By then, two of the corporate protagonists were dead and employees of the giant engineering conglomerate had taken charge of its destiny

Dubai-based Chhabria had burst on the Indian business scene only two years before with a series of high-profile buys like Shaw Wallace, Dunlop, Hindustan Dorr-Oliver, to name a few. His entry, however, was less than welcome for India's professional managers not least because of his brash management style. So, when Chhabria turned his attentions to the blue-chip L&T, a company that had been established in 1938 by two Danish engineers but lacked identifiable promoters and an attractive target for takeover tycoons, the company's management duly reacted.

Chairman N M Desai asked Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman, Dhirubhai Ambani to invest in the company's shares as a white knight. Now, Ambani, then well on his way to becoming one of India's most powerful businessmen, rarely let any opportunity pass and he immediately bought 12.4 per cent from the open market. Backed by the Congress Party, Ambani continued to corner more shares from the open market and by 1989 increased his stake to 18.5 per cent by spending close to Rs 190 crore. Remember, all this took place long before the takeover code and market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India came into play.

But Ambani was no white knight in the conventionally understood sense of the term. Armed with his sizeable stake, he immediately sought, and was granted, board seats for himself and for his sons Mukesh and Anil. It was Desai, the man who had invited Ambani on board, who paid the price for his defensive strategy. He was shunted out as chairman in favour of Dhirubhai.

L&T soon realised that the advent of the Ambanis may have warded off the threat from Chhabria but it was to be no picnic under the Ambani dispensation. L&T was important for Reliance because the company was constructing RIL's petrochemicals complex. But Ambani was also interested in L&T's substantial cash flows.

As chairman of L&T, one of Ambani's first decisions was to ask the company to grant RIL supplier's credit of Rs 570 crore. The cash-rich construction company was also asked to buy RIL shares worth Rs 76 crore from the market from entities close to Reliance. Another controversial decision by Ambani was to make L&T take on more debt.

But the party soon ended for the Ambanis.

In 1989, in a humiliating defeat, the Congress, led by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, lost power to V P Singh. Soon it became clear that the new Prime Minister Singh was not a friend of the Ambanis or any big business, for that matter; Singh's tenure saw the revival of the raid raj. The government immediately asked state-owned Life Insurance Corporation, the dominant shareholder, to make sure that the Ambanis were out of L&T.

Ambani was forced to resign from the board and former State Bank of India chairman D N Ghosh was asked to replace him. This was also the time when Ambanis were fighting a bitter battle with Nusli Wadia of Bombay Dyeing for supremacy in the petrochemicals business. The Indian Express, led by its feisty Chairman Ramnath Goenka and editor Arun Shourie, wrote a series of exposes about RIL, its controversial takeover of L&T among them.

Meanwhile, under Ghosh, L&T immediately withdrew the supplier's credit to Reliance and started off-loading RIL shares in the market. Though Dhirubhai's sons Mukesh and Anil were still on L&T's board, they soon realised that with a hostile government at the Centre, it was impossible to control the company, since the majority shareholding was still with government-owned institutions.

But luck favoured Ambani. V P Singh's minority government soon collapsed and was replaced in 1990 by Chandra Shekhar, who had closer links to the Ambanis. Ghosh was asked to resign. The Supreme Court also ruled in Ambani's favour. But the economy was also in ruins as a result of a drain on the country's forex reserves. With the general elections of 1991 bringing the Congress back to power in a minority government under PV Narasimha Rao , the Ambanis tried to make a comeback.

In June 1991, the Ambanis had enough shares and proxies to vote Dhirubhai Ambanai back as chairman and Mukesh as the managing director. But following pressure from the Opposition, Prime Minister Rao decided to stay away from the battle. In fact, following orders from the then finance minister Manmohan Singh LIC sought an adjournment of the Extraordinary General Meeting in August 1991 which was to vote on bringing Ambanis back to L&T. Shareholders close to Ambanis, however, refused to vacate the hall.

By then, the Ambanis also realised that it would not be possible for the Congress-led minority to openly support them. Hence, by September they decided to stay away from L&T and dropped resolutions to be installed as chairman and managing director.

After that, the Ambanis stayed on as passive investors in L&T for more than a decade. The calm seemed to have returned on L&T with professionals managing the company. But the Ambanis had one more surprise in store for the company.

In November 2001, the Ambanis abruptly sold their remaining 10.05 per cent stake in L&T to Kumar Mangalam Birla's Grasim. Grasim was directly competing with L&T in the cement business, which is why it wanted to take over the company.

But Birla completely misunderstood one person: A M Naik, the doughty CEO & MD of the company appointed only three year before. Born and educated in a Gujarat village, Naik was not to be cowed down by the corporate raiders. He soon rallied L&T employees behind him and exhorted them to take destiny in their own hands. Instead of remaining servants to others, Naik asked his employees to become owners of the company. ""We should perform so well that it should become impossible for anyone to buy shares in our company because good results will make the stock expensive,"" Naik told them.

Under Naik, L&T finally found its true leader from within. Naik fought Birla's entry into the company tooth and nail and made representations to everyone from the prime minister to LIC to let L&T retain its professional management culture. After months of negotiations, Birla exited L&T by selling its stake to an employees' trust run by L&Ts employees in June 2003. In return, Birlas received L&T's cement division and named it UltraTech. It was a win-win deal for both. The fate of L&T was finally in the hands of its own employees.

From then on, there has been no turning back for L&T and Naik. Since June 2003, the market value of L&T has gone up 25 times, from Rs 6,000 crore to Rs 1,47,000 crore now, with its employees owning 12 per cent of the company. That makes it impossible for anyone to make a hostile raid on it. Naik's dream to make L&T create its own destiny has finally come true. "

* Building a bio gas powered bike.

Highlights

* Indian Air Force officer addresses first. Pakistan Air Force planes were intercepted. In the aerial combat, one F-16 aircraft was shot down by an IAF MiG Bison. IAF lost one MiG, he says and refers to the capture of the IAF pilot. 
* Pakistan resorted to indiscriminate firing on Feb. 26 and was befittingly retalitated.  Given the high level of preparedness Pak designs were foiled.  We are in a heightened state of alert, he (Army Maj. Gen Bahal) says. 
* Navy remains poised in all three dimensions to defeat Pakistan's provocations. 
* AVM Kapoor says piece of evidence is being presented about the aircraft being used by Pakistan based on electronic signature.  Pakistan media reports showing engine parts were not of MiG 21s, he says adding that it could be concluded that F-16s were used.

The electricity provider in my area uses every excuse in the book to delay the installation of net-meters, since it drives down their revenues.

Another interesting thing about net-metering with rooftop solar is that when you generate excess electricity during the day, your neighbors who don't have rooftop solar end up bearing the hidden costs of electricity transmission/distribution/generation. This will become an issue when a larger number of people start adopting solar power and there is no demand and cost based correction of units accrued by excess solar generation. "

2. IBSPL (the front company for Jio in the auctions) didnt bid for BWA spectrum for mobile operations. Infact, DoT's explicit position was that this spectrum was to be used for broadband and not voice calling. Jio/IBSPL paid Rs 1500 crores for this spectrum, a fraction of price paid by Airtel/Vodafone. 
3. Post Jio buying out IBSPL, they were granted the rights to use this spectrum for cellular services! Neat!
4. Jio's launch of services were predatory in nature. They would have been stopped in any country that respects its law/has a decent anti-competition framework. 
5. Jio offered their services for free as a part of field trials and demanded that their competitors not charge for any calls made by Jio users to their network (IUC charges). TRAI sided with them. Field trials are typically for 90 days. Jio had acquired 100 Million customers through trials which basically lasted months/way longer 
6. Jio didnt make data cheap. They just made it cheap/free long enough for most of the incumbents to bleed out. 

From having a very robust competition (Docomo brought in the pay per second concept, Uninor brought in unlimited usage, Aircel was offering brilliant competition in TN), we now have 3 players and BSNL. 

 Telcos are already at peak capacity in most circles and only VI/BSNL has any room to grow, albeit with very little money. There is no incentive for anyone to better their services since who can you switch to and the way we treated Vodafone, Docomo and Telenor is enough to scare away any new player looking to enter the market.

I hope I can save at-least one person from these fraudsters,269,k7oy2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k7oy2n/hello_rindia_please_learn_from_my_mistake_i_hope/,72,1607266808.0,"Backstory: I used to work in Chennai and moved to Visakhapatnam during the lockdown. I vacated my house but I left few of my stuff at my friend's house so that I can pick them up later once this shit-fest of 2020 ends. My friend calls me up saying that he wants to vacate the house too just like me and asks me take a decision on what to do with my stuff at his place. I thought about various options and decided to bring back my stuff to Vizag because I wasn't sure when I'll be back to office. 

So I enquire about packers and movers and found out that agarwal packers and movers was hella costly but had a very reputable name. Then I spoke to dtdc packers and movers who quoted me a price of 80/kg which seemed reasonable at the time. We agreed on a time so that my friend would be there to oversee the packing and stuff. 

First red flag:
Couple of people came on 3rd Dec and packed everything and then came the first red flag. They said they forgot the weighing scale and that it's present at the godown. Both me and my friend were really busy with both of us having important meetings(production downtime) and I wasn't really thinking about how anything can go wrong with dtdc being a well know company. So they took all of my stuff without giving any receipt (first red flag)

Second red flag:
This realisation dawned on me that I have no receipt of them taking my stuff and then I called the guy who I was speaking to over the phone and he said, he will send me the bill/receipt in an hour. After an hour, I followed up he said, he's busy, he'll send it tomorrow by 11am. I followed up promptly he sends me a bill for 15.7k which was another red flag because the bill shouldn't have crossed 5k at max according to the rate we discussed. I refused to pay and asked for my stuff back, he said that that can't happen, they have left Chennai and is at a hub. The only option is for me to pay in full. I went back and forth with him and then we came to an aggreement that I was to pay and advance of 10k and that he would provide me a docket number which would allow me to track my stuff online. So I did.

Major Red flag#3: After I paid the amount at around 12 pm 4th dec, he verified he received the payment and that he'll initiate the process in 2-3 hours and send me the link. I called him up and he says, it will get done next day. I called him up again next day, he said it will get done by 1pm. I call him up again at 3pm, he says by EOD he will send the docket number. This was the last time I spoke to him. After that he didn't attend any of my calls. I dug a little deeper into this company as I was freaking out if I fell for a scam and lo and behold, so many further red flags came up: The website which I found the number: [http://www.dtdcpackersmovers.com/](http://www.dtdcpackersmovers.com/) didn't have a secure connection. None of the social media icons actually lead to any valid social media site. That's when I knew I fucked up big time.

Things I lost to this scam:
1. my TV.
2. a table
3. a chair
4. few trekking equipment
5. few clothes
6. kitchenware.
7. My peace of mind(most important of all!)
The total value of the goods is around 1L. I'm not sad that I lost all of these stuff but that I got so fooled so easily and that my trust in people in generally suffered because of this.

I have recorded all of my conversations with this guy and few other people I have spoken to. I have the pictures of the people who came to pick up my stuff and the registered number of pickup truck that they came with. I also have the receipt which has the office address : [receipt!](https://imgur.com/5nVZnNR)

I'm posting this because I'm feeling humiliated and don't want this to happen with anyone else. If anyone has any ideas on how I can get my stuff back I will owe you one _/\_

edit:

Suggestions I have gotten so far:
1. report to godaddy
2. report this to dtdc
3. report to police.

Yet Make In India remains a failure. And the government seems perplexed as to why.

The reality is that our policymakers have a very crude understanding of manufacturing. They grossly overestimate fixed resources and fail to understand the importance of supply chains - the sole reason why China is winning.

Unless you're making extremely simple goods (like, say matchsticks), every product you make will be made up of multiple parts. The more advanced the product, the more parts it will have. 

There is no factory in the world that can make all the parts needed for a complex product. You will need to source different parts from different factories, often located across the world.

If you want to make your product efficiently, you need to ensure that ALL parts reach you a) on time and b) predictably.

The latter is extremely important. If you're a manufacturer, you NEED to know that a shipment will reach your factory every 30 days without delay. 

As any project manager will tell you, a small delay in one task can lead to long delays in all the tasks that depend on it. If you're making a cellphone, if the microprocessor doesn't reach you from Taiwan in time, the entire manufacturing process is held up.

This is the bit where India loses out heavily.

Our supply chains are simply not consistent enough and predictable enough. If you import a component, there is no guarantee that it will reach your factory in X number of days. Depending on the traffic at the port, the whims of the customs agents, and the traffic on the highway from the port to the factory, your shipment might reach you in X+Y days.

A myriad number of things can arbitrarily delay shipments in India. The government might change import duties or impose restrictions randomly (as it has done recently), destroying established supplier relationships. The customs agents can hold up a shipment for any arbitrary reason. Some protestors might hold up the highway, creating a logjam. 

This unpredictability is anathema to modern manufacturing, where speed and efficiency are paramount, not fixed costs. China's share of global manufacturing has gone UP recently despite rising labor costs. And it's happened because unlike its competitors, China understands that the most important thing for manufacturers is stable and predictable supply chains.

As long as India ignores this crucial issue, Make In India will continue to fail. Land and labor and laws are important, but it's even more important to remove arbitrariness in laws, bureaucracy in customs, and unpredictability in transport.",False,Policy/Economy,"Japan has a really good system.

Lately ive been noticing that men (99% of the time Indian) would just profess their love to a woman online. You could see examples of these mainly on YouTube. A comment made by a woman would have atleast one reply from an Indian male asking her to marry him or something along those lines. Why do these men ruin it for every indian out there? Ive had several experiences of my own:

Exhibit A : I commented on youtube under a Shane Dawson video and a few minutes later I get a notification that someone subscribed to my channel. Weird, i thought, I just have one video up, whats there to subscribe to? But i let it go. Another few minutes later, I get notified of a comment on my video (one that I posted) and it said ""i love you ❤❤"" yes,including the hearts. Now the video I posted happened to be one i took at a concert of my fav artist so I thought this guy was just proffessing his love for the above mentioned artist. I commented back ""yeah, me too. I love liam payne"" . The reply to my comment? ""No, i love you"".  This dude doesnt even know my name. 

Exhibit B : I was part of a whattsapp group that shared notes for an exam i was preparing for. One guy had posted a very helpful trick for a certain topic and said that he was willing to share more privately. Obviously, being the idiot i was, I send him a message asking for the notes. To be fair, he did send the notes, excellent ones might i add and I thought that was the end of that. Nope, a month later( the very next day after the exam) he started whattsapp calling me. I didnt pick up cause I dont pick up strange numbers. He sends me a message asking me why i didnt pick up the call.   I thought this was a friend of mine and i said i was busy. Here is how the conversation went

Him : you can never be too busy for your future husband ( A/N : I wish i was making this up)

ME : What the fuck dude? Is this a prank? Do I know you?

Him: I really love you. Please.
Obviously I blocked him but he popped up again with a new number.
 At first I ignored him but then it started getting low-key harrassement. He knew I dont live in India so he started asking me to fly him to my country where we could live happily ever after. At one point I doubted if this was actually a prank, but realised nope dude's just dumb. I straight out told him to stop and leave me the fuck alone.  The guy told me to send nudes which earned him a block and a report.

I am not from the IT world so a lot of it does not make sense to me but despite this I know that whitehat and Byju's are terrible to say the least. I am from the commerce background and today I came to know about JuniorMBA by a company called Clever Harvey ([https://www.cleverharvey.com](https://www.cleverharvey.com)).

Their pitch - "" Clever Harvey's programs for 21st Century  Skills bridge the gap between academics and the real world and help  every learner compete globally. ""

Their founder Sriram Subramanian has said “Before we buy a car, we test drive it. Before we buy a full scoop of ice cream, we ask for a taster. Before we pick a career, we only rely on someone else’s advice? Coding has offered an interesting early preview into tech careers, but we found that there is no equivalent for the business world. Thus, we launched the JuniorMBA. It has been so fulfilling to see the joy on our students’ faces at understanding the corporate world, and the relief for the parents as they see their teen get career clarity"".

As per their site they offer 3 courses - JuniorCEO, Junior CMO & JuniorCTO. All 3 courses have 10 classes.

JuniorCEO -  In 10 classes, learn to lead with the entrepreneurship and decision-making skills of a **Chief Executive Officer**.

JuniorCMO -  In 10 classes, influence the world with the strategic communication skills of a **Chief Marketing Officer.** 

JuniorCTO -  In 10 classes, go beyond just coding and build the analytical and problem-solving skills of a **Chief Technology Officer.**

They are targeting teens with this. You could argue that this is not as bad as whitehat but it is. Their Youtube channel has a showcase videos of their successful Alumnis and one of the products showcased is called Shield Pulse - a ""smart band"" that notifies the owner of a property if their watchman fell asleep while on duty. The video is disturbing to me because the kids in the video talk about this ""problem"" and have zero empathy.

155,Today’s notification on online news media and OTT platforms will require greater vigilance,372,js6qmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/js6qmp/todays_notification_on_online_news_media_and_ott/,120,1605124077.0,"https://preview.redd.it/jbzjialfmly51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a219db7565c1937f1ba1f1f0da8a183a40fab27

Today the Cabinet Secretariat issued a notification under the business of allocation rules stating that digital and online media falls within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB). The notification essentially means that MIB will have principal jurisdiction over, *first* online news and current affairs content and *second* films and audiovisual programmes made available by online content providers (also called OTT providers).

So the question arises what does this change mean? And second, why is there a level of apprehension that arises due to it?  


https://preview.redd.it/5qncqv42mly51.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=1162373061b2d5561311025a23e0fb26feb5218d

**What does this mean?**  


Here it is first important to take a step back and consider the role the MIB has played conventionally. It has administered both licensing and content censorship powers in the radio, cinema and television broadcasting specifically through laws such as the Cinematograph Act and the Cable Television Regulations Act. Hence, it has an institutional history of regulation.  


This has been done both with respect to entities are permitted to operate within certain sectors of news and general entertainment but also indirectly exercised governance over content. For instance film certification which is popularly known as being done through censor boards. Now, the online content sector is also enveloped within the ambit of the MIB somewhat similarly to radio, cinema and television. However, there is largely an absence of legislation that may require either licensing or a form of content certification like for movies.  


**Why is there nervousness?**  


We all know the internet is a very different medium than cinemas or theaters. It presents different challenges and opportunities. Here there exists a level of nervousness as to whether today’s notification can be a precursor to any form of licensing or result in censorship.  


* Journalism Platforms: Here there is a level of anticipation firstly with respect to who all would fall within the ambit of such regulation and what would be its nature. We believe that online media and journalism is vital to our democracy and present innovative models through which specialised services focussing through models of subscriptions or news-letters provide incredible value to end users. Furthermore, even the type of content which may be investigative, or specialised focussing on topical subjects like technology and startups are serving real value and need. Here, there is a degree of nervousness about what shape any potential regulation or a legislation will take. One such measure is the pending process that considers amendments to [**the Press and Registration of Books Bill, 2019**](https://internetfreedom.in/say-no-to-overregulation-of-digital-news-media-and-social-media/). Now, it’s an open question, whether this, or any other legislative measures, will cause censorship or bring in compliances that while aimed at checking social problems such as, “fake news” may just result in greater government control?
* Online video streaming platforms (such as Amazon Prime, Disney-Hotstar, Netflix): To be clear this would mark a clear departure from the past stand of principally the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) and joined by the MIB which had in the [***Justice for Rights Case*** **made a submission** ](https://internetfreedom.in/take-it-and-go/)that there was no need for regulation under the Cinematograph Act for prior licensing of content. Further, if any complaints arose against online streaming providers then offences under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860 were available. We even sent a letter to MEITY congratulating them for this progressive stand. However, there are signs that such statements [**may not be equivocal and there may be a Cinematographer style regulation**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-certifiable-dampener/). According to us this would be a very bad idea for freedom of speech and media diversity. It would hurt creators, viewers and the cultural export and local content development of diverse content which is showcasing India’s creative, soft power on the global stage.  


So in both instances, while nervousness is understandable, please do consider adoption of some caution and paying greater attention to any potential legislative or executive action which may follow. Such policy shifts will be documented by us and we will keep you regularly informed and seek your active participation.  


**Vigilance and continued liberty**  


At IFF we are committed to serving the constitutional values of free expression that quite often today intersect with digital communication. We believe that any regulation of the online sector which may follow should be grounded in sound public policy choices which carry these values and also serve innovation. Towards this we commit to remaining vigilant, working with associations, groups and bodies and a broad range of stakeholders including the government in good faith. We believe that the opportunities that the online space provides far outweigh the harms and will continue to take all actions to secure the interests of end users.

I need your opinions to prove my mother wrong.,18,k7tdv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k7tdv6/gen_z_younger_millenials_of_india_i_need_your/,40,1607288504.0,"Yesterday, my mom told me that my older cousin (22) is looking to get married. She is a Chartered accountant (or going to be one? Idk..i dont keep up with her ). But i was surprised this 22y/o child wants to get married. She is only 3 years older than me.

My cousin comes from a very poor family. She has an alcoholic for a dad . Ive heard horror stories from her about how she was preparing for her board exams  while her dad was hitting her mom in the other room. Now she wants to get married because she thinks marriage is her only ticket out of poverty and this miserable life . I dont mind that. Sure, her life, her choices. But she is a CA for heaven sake. She can make enough money to pull atleast 3 families out of poverty if she wanted to. Why get married for that? But the thought that women can only be successful with a man is ingrained in the poor girls head and she is acting upon it. Again, if thats what she wants to do with her life, who am I to judge her? 

But she wants an Arranged marriage. 
 
I have nothing against arranged marriage. But I just thought people in our generation didnt believe in arranged marriage. I thought we gave more value to love over status or pleasing out relatives. When i told my mom this she said that I was wrong and that kids these days ARE going back to arrabged marriage. When I told her no, she said that I was being influenced by western media and I should spend more time with Indian teens/young adults (I dont live in India. None of my Indian friends approve of AM). She also said something along the lines of how young adults these days choose to have kids before 30 because they want to grow older with the kids. From what ive read people are choosing not to have kids at all !!

My mom told me not to worry about marriage or kids now and to focus on my studies now But..Im 19. I'll be 22 in a few years. Will I be excepted to get married then? Shit, im scared.

So..r/India, Am I the one wrong here? Did the young population revert back to this age old tradition? Am I just living a fairy taillife expecting to find ny own prince charming and getting married whenever i want when it wont happen?


Edit: My mother had always thought me and my sister that only a woman who is well educated and has a good career can fight back against patriarchy. She always taught us to be independednt so that we dont have to depend on a man. Hell, my parents had a love marriage. I can't understand when she changed her way of thinking.",False,AskIndia,"I don't think you're mother is entirely wrong. But she is definitely wrong in putting an entire generation into one single basket. In my general observation things for current gen are going in the following ways and can be classified accordingly. I can't speak for your cousin but kids in general, subconsciously don't want to go against their parents. They might not even realize it but every decision they take is influenced by their upbringing even if they feel they have the freedom of choice. Millenials from Orthodox families are conditioned to get an arranged marriage, have a big fat wedding and move on. That's just the way of life. Now, this is Type 1.

Moving on, there are families with a fairly moderate outlook. These kids know that their parents are ok (with a little convincing) with them getting married to whosever they choose (within reasonable limits of course, for example inter-religion or ethnicity would be a big no). This group forms the majority of people I know. The important thing among these people is that although the pressure to get an arranged marriage isn't there, the pressure to get married is always there. They don't want to see their kids single in their 30's. So the pressure to get married begins once the kids hit 25. A lot of people I know are in this age group, and don't have a serious relationship that they consider is marriage worthy. Some of them have tried multiple times and failed. At some point they just throw hands 🤷‍♂️ and let their parents take over. This is type 2.

There are also family with a complete liberal outlook. However, like myself, the kid could be ultra socially awkward incel weeb with zero chances of landing a girl. They can't find anyone and the prospect of dying alone scares them. At some point they might just cave in and consider arranged marriage as an option. This is type 3. "

I remember in my second year a batchmate died by suicide and we got a mail and the next day the whole institution worked like nothing had happened. There were no emails mourning the loss or asking students to meet them if they were affected by the loss. Not just authorities, most students had a very similar attitude. A batchmate of mine thought mental health issues aren't real; they are imaginary. They've Icare to deal with mental health issues which is an elaborate fraud. I hope someday someone will sue them. In India to practice as a Clinical Psychologist, a Mphil in Clinical Psychology is needed. No one on the team is qualified to be called one. Most of them hold Masters in Psychology or Clinical Psychology which isn't enough to practice alone but unfortunately the trend is very common in India. To work as a Counselor a diploma in counselling is needed and somehow they've overlooked the requirement. They even have someone with a Masters in Sociology and call her Social Psychologist. She conducts therapy sessions. They are pretty bad but that for them isn't enough to change the criterion. 

Indian mentality to question student's worth is so sick. Made me wonder if intellectual ability measured the worth of someone's life and if it did what about all the educated and successful Indians who hold such regressive thoughts. It made me feel so sick. I saw a face of Indian society I wasn't familiar with before. Anyway, didn't voice my opinions back then, needed to get them off my chest.",False,Non-Political,"Are IITians lives more important than other students' lives? Your post is quite contradictory?

**[Congress Manifesto](https://manifesto.inc.in/en/)**

The BJP Manifesto is available in Hindi and English, while the Congress Manifesto is available in Hindi, English, Odia, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Assamese.

I've provided a few highlights from both the manifestos. The manifestos are large and it is not possible to cover all the points. I have covered the points which I believe are easier to judge on implementability.

182,"The Bollywood film ‘Dhoom’ (2004), misinterpreted as an action thriller, is in fact a rigorous allegorical analysis of economic policies, particularly in the Indian context in the early ‘00s.",235,joloo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/joloo3/the_bollywood_film_dhoom_2004_misinterpreted_as/,95,1604622189.0,"Spoilers ahead.

Connoisseurs of film are undoubtedly well-aware of *La Nouvelle Vague*, aka, the ‘New Wave’—an experimental movement in filmmaking with its origins in the French cinema of the 1950s, with an emphasis on exploration of personal themes such as existentialism, iconoclasm and absurdism. Although the ‘New Wave’ is considered to have met its chronological end in the late 1960s, to be followed by successive movements like ‘New Hollywood’, ‘Cinema Novo’ and ‘Dogme 95’, the influence of *la nouvelle vague* continues to be keenly felt in the artistic masterpieces of Bollywood production house *YRF*. Under the skillful hand of renowned auteur Aditya Chopra, the studio has produced a lineup of commercially successful arthouse flicks that continue the French filmmaking renaissance of the ‘50s, successfully infusing avant-garde storytelling techniques with high production values and modern Indian themes.  Nowhere is this revolutionary vision more evident than in films like *DDLJ* (a masterpiece in abstract, absurdist storytelling), *Mohabbatein* (a sensitive examination of the taboo topic of attitudes towards adolescent self-gratification), *Kal Ho Naa Ho* (an ambitious adaptation of historian David McCullough’s book 1776), *Jab Tak Hai Jaan* (a religio-philosophical drama that engages in debate upon the tenets of Christianity, Shaivism, and the cultural taboo of Kala Pani) and, of course, the *Dhoom* franchise.

As *YRF*’s most popular franchise, the *Dhoom* series has, with each installment, made great independent strides in cinematic theory and practice. Although—as read above—*YRF* films explore a wide, varying range of topics as a whole, the *Dhoom* franchise focuses exclusively on the examination and discussion of economic and socio-economic matters of policy and practice in the Indian context. Over the course of 3 films, the discourse acquires a rich depth, with the analysis of issues including the economic costs and benefits of national highway construction, the clash between entrepreneurial aspirations and the security of bureaucratic employment, the 2008 economic recession in the BRICS context, and the causes and consequences of non-performing bank loans and a profiling of defaulters of on said loans. Indeed, a first course on Indian economics at any prestigious institution may well be framed around careful viewing and discussion of the *Dhoom* films. In the careful hands of Aditya Chopra and Vijay Krishna Acharya (*Dhoom 1/2/3*, *Tashan*, *Thugs of Hindostan*), each *Dhoom* film achieves a delicate balance between the overt cops-and-robbers heist story and the covert exploration of complex economic schools of thought.

As the 1st film in the franchise, *Dhoom* (2004) establishes the storytelling framework for the films to come, and by itself explores the challenges and opportunities presented by Indian economic policymaking in the early ‘00s. The film features an all-round star-studded cast, with support from Honorary Roadie & *Stardust Awards* nominee Esha Deol, *Star’s Sabsey Award* winner Rimi Sen, and *Indian Telly Award* nominee Arav Chowdharry. At the film’s helm are *Lions Club Award* winner John Abraham, *Sansui Award* winner Abhishek Bachchan, and *Emmy* nominee Uday Chopra. Series regulars Bachchan and Chopra play Jai and Ali respectively, Jai being a policeman and Ali a small-time mechanic with a penchant for fast bikes and disinterested women. Abraham essays the villainous role of Kabir, part-time restaurant waiter and part-time leader of a gang of biker thieves. 

The film begins with a series of daring heists pulled off by Kabir’s gang, relying on their high-speed bikes to orchestrate sudden thefts and promptly escape the scene soon after. Their exploits catch the eye of Jai, a lifetime appointee to the post of Assistant Commissioner of Police. Jai, however, finds himself out of his depth and through a series of accidents, makes the acquaintance of Ali, a mildly-seedy mechanic and bike racer. Initially reluctant to be associated with law enforcement, Ali is eventually induced to join Jai’s cause and attempt to chase down Kabir and his merry band of men. *Dhoom* is slow and deliberate in its setup, and the film’s early minutes are heavy on subtext and detail, therefore, it is essential to take in the plot in small increments, so as to be thorough with one’s analysis. 

In an allegorical sense, Jai, as a police officer, represents bureaucratic authority and the security, comforts and powers of government employment. Abraham’s Kabir, as a thief, is a *laissez-faire* capitalist, relying on his material advantage in the form of fast bikes and his manpower advantage in the form of skilled bikers to partake in a series of one-sided transactions with economic entities such as banks and government funds. In this sense, the act of robbery in *Dhoom* is merely a transaction between two private parties wherein one side gains an unfair amount at the other’s expense, absent external interventionism. In addition to being a free-market advocate, Kabir is also an employee at a pizza parlour, which seems to be the film’s attempt at exploring both the growing role of the service economy as a share of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the amorphous nature of employment within the modern ‘gig’ economy. Caught between the competing ideas of state-control and free capitalism, Chopra’s Ali is a stand-in for the directionless youth, lured by the safety and dignity of a government job, whilst simultaneously seduced by the potential for greater wealth presented by free-market capitalism. The film’s plot is overt in this depiction, with Ali simultaneously fearful of Jai’s authority, yet desirous of wielding said authority as an employed policeman. Furthermore, in an action sequence set in Mumbai’s Chor Bazaar—a flea market specializing in illegally-hawked goods—Jai and Ali get into a fight with goons in the market, and are forced to make a hasty escape after being outnumbered. Ali bringing Jai to the market illustrates his ties to the informal, underground economy—a large, undocumented component of the Indian economy—and Jai’s subsequent fleeing the scene highlights the failed outcome of government attempts to regulate this grey economy by force and bluster. 

Initially at a loss for clues, Jai is eventually able to deduce that Kabir’s bikers arrange their heists in close proximity to highways, providing as the highways do quick getaways after. This is no doubt an allusion to the economic importance of the National Highways Authority of India’s flagship ‘Golden Quadrilateral’ national highway construction project. Kabir, the raw capitalist, is empowered in his capitalistic pursuits by the government’s infrastructure investments, and John Abraham’s moody expression throughout the film is in no small part perhaps due to the discontentment within Kabir’s mind about his enterprise’s dependence on resources provided by the state. Having deduced Kabir’s MO, Jai and Ali attempt to catch him in the act. However, Kabir and his gang appear to have substantially faster bikes than Jai and Ali, which is undoubtedly an allusion to the government’s perceived ineptitude and inability to generally compete with private enterprise. Left chafing and chasing the dust, Jai catches a lucky break when an overconfident Kabir offers him a clue about his upcoming crime, with the catch being that if Jai fails to avert it, he must recuse himself from the case and leave Kabir to his entrepreneurial pursuits. Kabir, the staunch capitalist, is here hinting at the idea of termination clauses in Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), agreements between enterprises and governments for mutual benefit. Whilst the government naturally retains the right to sever the partnership at any point, Kabir clearly believes that he, as the private party, is also entitled to terminate the contract should the government, aka Jai, default on the agreed-upon terms. Formally known as the ‘Authority Default’ concept, Dhoom represents this idea in the form of a simple, easy to understand challenge between Jai and Kabir. 

Even as this layered conflict plays out between Jai and Kabir, Ali is enamoured by the mysterious ‘Dilbara’ (Esha Deol). Little is known about Dilbara, however, like other characters in the film, it may be reasonably assumed than she is also an allegorical depiction of an economic concept. Ali’s infatuation with her suggests that she is perhaps intended to be portrayed as a vague, undefined avenue of aspirational employment. Furthermore, the fact that she (as is later revealed) is in fact a part of Kabir’s gang, yet also harbours feelings for Ali, leads one to conclude that Dilbara represents a form of compromise between *dirigisme*, aka restrictive state-controlled economy, and *laissez-faire* anarcho-capitalism. The filmmakers leave the specifics of this compromise vague, however, Dilbara’s skimpy outfits perhaps represent the scantiness of opportunities presented by this nebulous alternative. 

Returning to the main plot, Jai, despite being forewarned, fails to foil Kabir’s next robbery, despite being able to take down one of his gang in the process. Left short of a gang member, Kabir attempts to recruit Ali, left sidelined by Jai following their failure to catch Kabir. The jilted Ali readily embraces Kabir’s neoliberal worldview and the duo jet off to Goa, where Kabir has his eyes set on one final score from a casino. Subtextually, the casino and gambling in general represent what is in Kabir’s eyes an essential component of his brand of capitalism—rampant speculation and volatility that may be manipulated to one’s benefit. There may also be an addition reference to British academic Susan Strange’s seminal 1986 work *Casino Capitalism*, a critique of unregulated banking and financial systems. However, Kabir is more likely than not to be derisive of such thoughts, and therefore, if this reference was intended, it may merely be made to indicate the filmmakers’ complete mastery over both Keynesian and Austrian schools of economic thought.

The importance of dance numbers in *YRF* films cannot be overstated. Even as Bollywood music gravitates towards being little more than catchy jingles designed to elicit maximum publicity, the music and dance numbers in *YRF* films complement the plot perfectly, serving to both entertain and narrate. *Dhoom* is no exception to this tradition of excellence. On the eve of Kabir’s final heist, an inebriated Jai shows up at the casino, claiming to have left police employment and moved on. Kabir, however, is rightly suspicious, given as Jai is still a cop, and is merely attempting to lure Kabir into a false sense of comfort as a prelude to catching him in the act. This Jai accomplishes by putting on a song-and-dance in front of Kabir to convince him of his abandonment of state-sponsored socialism and his embrace of Kabir’s unrestrained capitalism. The song is entitled ‘Salamee’, a clever homophone of ‘salami’, a sausage that consists primary of beef. The consumption of beef was, in a landmark 2005 Supreme Court judgement, forbidden on grounds on anti cow-slaughter laws. Kabir, as an opponent of government intervention, would likely have been opposed to the idea of such a restriction being imposed upon him. Therefore, to show his solidarity to the cause, Jai takes to the stage in front of Kabir and sways to the refrain of *“Naye kal ko aao kare, hum karein, karein/Salami, salami, salami/Kar le salami…”*.

The subterfuge is apparently successful, and a placated Kabir is lulled into a false sense of security by Jai’s reinforcement of his worldview. However, as mentioned, Jai’s conversion is little more than a ruse, and a hoodwinked Kabir is successfully caught in the act by Jai and Ali, who is revealed to have been Jai’s mole all along. The ever-slippery Kabir, however, weasels his way out of Jai’s clutches, and flees with his loot. Although *Dhoom 3* would better address the phenomenon of loan defaulters taking flight from the verge of captivity, *Dhoom* too takes a cursory look at the occurrence, although Kabir does not quite embody a loan defaulter. He is merely the free-market capitalist, the robber baron caught flouting regulations and fleeing from the consequences of government intervention. A long chase sequence ensues, with Kabir fleeing but ultimately cornered by Jai and Ali at the precipice of a sea-facing cliff. Facing a choice between certain captivity and death, Kabir chooses to fly off the cliff with the last of his loot. In a literal sense, Kabir merely dies by falling off the cliff into the sea. In a figurative sense, faced with the prospect of his enterprise being forced to comply with ungainly regulations, Kabir chooses instead to offshore his business, and make for better waters, thus bringing his character arc to a natural and satisfying conclusion. A frustrated Jai bemoans his end, representing the government’s exasperation at ultimately failing to bring a rogue enterprise to heel. Ali, having seen his capitalistic expectations dive off a cliff with Kabir, chooses in the film’s final shot, to finally pursue the path to safe, steady, state-sponsored employment after all, asking Jai if he finally is a bona-fide police officer, as the film fades to black. 

The topical nature of *Dhoom* is a cause for admiration, even a decade and a half after its release. The film successfully ties together strands of economic and socio-economic thought from its time—the ‘Golden Quadrilateral’ project received a major fillip in the first years of the new millennium, the service sector encountered a boom around the same time, as did the contribution of outsourcing to employment and economic growth. The rise of men like Kabir is perfectly timed in the post-License Raj years, as the country embraced capitalism over state socialism. Yet, the lure of stable, ‘safe’ government employment holds true, and powers men like Jai and seduces men like Ali. Dilbara’s unknown fate at the end of the film—left waiting for Ali by the side of a road—is representative of the uncertain outcomes of economic models with time. On a meta note, the *Dhoom* franchise’s casting of Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra in every film is a nod to the ‘Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act’ of 2005, a flagship government initiative that guarantees employment for a certain number of days out of the year, in the form of unskilled labour.

In summation, *Dhoom* rightly deserves its place as a seminal film in the annals of both *YRF* and Indian cinema. In its own right, it is a bold, experimental film that marries erudition to entertainment. It is also the progenitor of its celebrated franchise, providing the springboard from which future films would explore similar issues in an equally deft and precise fashion. To *YRF*, the *Dhoom* franchise, and Indian cinema, the film *Dhoom* is nothing short of a bottle of nitrous oxide, that when attached to a bike, propels it into the stratosphere.",False,Non-Political,"Wtf is this nonsense, it's a Bollywood money making flick which also happens to be a good movie to watch.

The ad goes like this. Ranveer is searching for a good potato to make chips out of but instead of a supermarket, it's a city of live walking animate potatoes. To find the good potato, he pretends that he tripped and throws his briefcase full of cash on the ground. A group of potatoes immediately flock around him trying to take that money when a much younger potato (with a very cute childlike voice) chases them off and gives the briefcase back to Ranveer. Ranveer then exclaims that he finally found the accha aalo (good potato) and crowns him (literally) as the good potato.

Cut to the next scene, an animation of a potato being peeled and made into chips is shown.

Now I know that the company wants to show that they only make chips out of good potatoes that are thoroughly searched for, but the only vibe I get from that ad is that good people die. A cute and innocent baby potato who did good was skinned and sliced and fried. Now that seems messed up. That's it, that's all I wanted to say. The idea was good but the fact that an ethically good person (or potato, but they had animate features) went down like that is messed up.

Is US objectively better than India?,217,jzft2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jzft2u/is_indian_middle_class_life_the_epitome_of/,283,1606158958.0,"EDIT: upper Middle class, double income household, single child. **PLEASE DON'T focus on the inaccuracy of my ""Middle Class"" labelling**, help with useful, specific comparisons of mentioned points. MOREOVER, this is how my PARENTS live - I have a decent middle class salary only, and no accumulated wealth.

**TL;DR**: I have maids, ever ready healthy food, good pay and purchasing power, freedom(could say lawlessness too), good education, parental support. Does it get any more comfortable?

I had hated on India for its various disadvantages, lack of public infrastructure, corruption and what not for a long time. I've always wanted to move to the US or Scandinavia/wherever I'd possibly find more out of life.

But at this time I wonder if I have almost everything a person would desire, which one may not even be able to get another in other countries easy or cheap. Enlisted below:

1. I have two maids, one that makes almost alright food (vegetarian) everyday and another that has OCD and cleans everything and takes care of the entire house quite well. I live in pretty small but airy flat(owned) in a very chill city. Although it's a Tier 2 city I still have most of the condiments and other things that I would need to prepare some kind of an American dinner if I wanted.



2. I basically have a plate of food ready when I want it and have loads of snacks and chocolates etc. I have a microwave oven, an induction stove and an Air-fryer which I use to heat up the food appropriately whenever desired. Also, Grocery is taken care of too, and most daily things can be ordered now over Amazon/jio/nature's basket etc.



3. My mum and dad are both Managers in a public sector company and have a respectable salary with considerable perks. My dad has contacts of specific helpers like electricians, carpenter, plumber etc that he calls whenever there's any problem in the house and pretty much gets it gets it fixed instantly (this is from own pocket, not office). This is something that'll cost you tonnes in a developed country. Also, I live with my parents during Covid so I don't need to worry about anything whatsoever.



4.  I myself have a fairly well paying job in the in the IT sector after having graduated through advanced degrees in an Elite college (compare it to the unaffordability of a good University in the US). Coupled with strong purchasing power, we can afford most small things easily. I have the freedom of leaving my job for a research career without a pay and then moving on to a hefty and often costly master's degree abroad (which I'm looking forward to, since Indian higher education sucks ass)



5. I was lucky enough in my childhood to have had trainings in art, music and dance for 8+ years without any hindrance. This was again quite cheap and the music teacher came to my home to teach me at an accelerated pace. Then I joined engineering coaching classes which were also so really fun and far more knowledge dispersing and stimulating than any standard 11-12th curriculum in the world, I would say. Doesn't necessarily translate to it being useful, I know, but still.



6. I can score 'stuff' pretty cheap and easy and have lots of friends open to sharing the joy. I've done my research on psychedelics so don't pick up on this. I've had the fortune and time and privelege to wonder, think and read about philosophy, psychology and the inner (and outer?) workings of the universe and conscious life. I know most of these things would be possible and encouraged in the developed countries with an upper middle class life too, as in India it's actually quite rare. I have the freedom to be vagrant and useless.

____________

**CONS**


General cons are lack of international food (eg BBQ - absent), extreme pollution, Corruption, extreme HEAT, traffic woes, widespread stupidity and rashness, overpopulation, competition and poor education.

One thing I brood over is the lack of concerts in India. I have my taste leaning in prog and Jazz etc and such artists won't ever come to India, and Music is a big part of my Life.

I won't say crime, because I think I am shielded from it because of my privilege, you might be more afraid of gun-weilding goons in the US than here.

Another I can think of is lack of good mental health support. I have an authoritative, narcissistic dad and that has given me issues. Depression, mild ADHD, chronic procrastination etc. Still struggling.

Plus there is an inherent racism(colour) and classism that exists in India that gets spotted with merely clothes and overall shabbiness, fluency in English etc that keeps you away from people not similar to your background. This might come off as offensive, but it's practiced subconsciously by almost everyone.



.....................

So, is this the epitome of a comfortable life? I know there are so many things that would be better off in the developed World along with stability and more opportunities to grow in career, but **I wish to know how better or worse does it get once you move to** US (unique experiences due to Visa issues) / Canada (collddd) / EU (free stuff etc) / any other country.

PS: This isn't any form of bragging. Sorry if you didn't like the naive tone. Take it as gratefulness and counting my blessings as I am growing up (I'm 23).

216,How abolition of APMC fared in Bihar — A Review,29,k99tou,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k99tou/how_abolition_of_apmc_fared_in_bihar_a_review/,9,1607481002.0,"Amidst all the protest and opposition to the new farm laws, Bihar has become a center of focus. This is because of one of the three farm laws in discussion, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, more commonly known as the APMC Amendment Act. Interestingly, Bihar had abolished the APMC Act in 2006. So what was the outcome?

It has been bad, to put it in one word. Recently published news report of the paddy farmers in Bihar reveals that the farmers are receiving anywhere between ₹900 to ₹1200 per quintal for their produce. This is about half of the MSP (minimum support price) fixed by the center, i.e. ₹1868. MSP relates to the cost of produce, which means farmers in Bihar are not even able to realize the amount they invested to produce the crop. Just a few months ago, farmers and activists in Bihar were sitting on an agitation for MSP on maize, went to the court, but to no avail.

Abolition of APMC has removed the market stabilising force with which price can be controlled. This has lead to wide fluctuation in prices. All existing infrastructure has declined. Private mandis operate in many parts which charge commission from farmers. Traders sell the grains in other states at MSP, where mandis are operational. Small and marginal farmers cannot sustain their families on the income, thus have to work in farms in Punjab and Haryana.

I'll add two more things in relation to Bihar. First, when the Bihar government repealed the APMC act, it did not abolish the mandis. They just went into a decline without funds or investment. Second, the government promised to procure grains for PDS (Public Distribution System) at MSP through PACS (Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies). However, these institutions have been a disaster. They fail to meet the procurement target, and are not able to ensure even the MSP.

[Bihar Did Not Meet Even 1% of its Wheat Procurement Target](https://thewire.in/agriculture/bihar-wheat-procurement-target-failure)

> Bihar was a pioneer in abolishing Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC). Agriculture remains one of the largest employment-generating sectors but Bihar has the lowest average monthly income per agricultural household (₹3,558) in the country.The national average is ₹6,426. More than 86% of Bihar’s marginal agricultural households are in debt compared to the national average of 63.6%. The agricultural growth rate fell to 0.6% in 2018-19 and crops recorded a negative growth rate of 3.9%.

> A study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research post the APMC reforms concluded that net income had been declining. Mr. Kumar’s government has simply abandoned Bihar’s farmers, who receive a price much lower than the MSP due to inefficiencies by procurement agencies. More than 80% of procurement centres have shut down since 2015. This Rabi season, less than 1% of Bihar’s wheat was procured.

**Addendum**

The Print has published a video comparing the agricultural economy of Punjab and Bihar. The video has made many erroneous claims, and false equivalencies.

[Punjab & Bihar: tale of 2 states — one slowing, one rising — and case for farm reforms - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kczsvCZ6hOY)

First Shekhar Gupta compared the total GSDP of Punjab and Bihar. Bihar indeed grew more faster than national average after Nitish Kumar came to power. But that is because of manufacturing and services. Agriculture growth, first increased a little, due to agricultural roadmaps introduced by Nitish Kumar, but has contracted again since past several years.

> The average annual growth in agriculture and allied activities during the pre-agriculture road map (2001-02 to 2007-08) was only about 2.0 per cent (Table 3.1).  During the period of the first agriculture road map, the growth rate accelerated to 3.1 per cent, which was almost equal to the national average agricultural growth. However, this higher growth in agriculture did not sustain in the long run. In fact, the average annual growth rate declined to 1.28 per cent during the period of the second agriculture road map. During the overall period 2001- 02 to 2016-17, average growth was only 2.0 per cent, which was much below the national average agricultural growth of 3.1 per cent.

*Study on Agricultural Diagnostics for the State of Bihar in India: National Council Of Applied Economic Research, page 37.*

Mr. Gupta said, that while agriculture in Punjab grew much faster following the green revolution, it stagnated later, and is growing slower than average now. This is not surprising at all. GDP (or GSDP) growth is how much your GDP (or GSDP) increased in the current year compared to previous year. If you are growing quickly, and you reach to a significantly high position, you cannot keep growing at the same pace forever. How this argument was used to compare Punjab of today and Bihar of today is anyone’s guess.

Shekhar Gupta claimed that Bihar achieved 4.7% growth in agricultural sector between 2006-15, and 7% in last five years. (12 min into the video). Both the claims are false.

I knew about Jio deep packet inspection and blocking but it wasn't much of a concern to me as I didn't mean they got direct access to my network devices.

However that changed after I got it installed and running today. Basically the router is locked down. You can't use non Jio routers to connect, there's no username / password settings to use for another non Jio router.

The biggest security issue is your Jio router can be managed by my Jio app like changing SSID, password, blocking device etc and it works even remotely (outside your WiFi network). So the only thing stopping a attacker is myjio authentication which I'm sure can be cracked. Moreover if they get access to network from Jio side, they can literally do anything.

In effect, the state of Jammu and Kashmir will now cease to exist; it will be replaced by two new Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. UTs have become states earlier; **this is the first time that a state has been converted into a UT.** The UT of Jammu and Kashmir will have an Assembly, like in Delhi and Puducherry. The UT of Ladakh will not, like Chandigarh.

So, not only has Jammu and Kashmir lost its special status, it has been given a status lower than that of other states.

It is also likely that corporates and individuals will be able to buy land in Jammu and Kashmir. Non-Kashmiris might now get jobs in Kashmir. A process of demographic change might begin, and progress over the coming decades.

>This is a state for whom the only currency that matters is raw power. This is a state that recognises no constraints of law, liberty and morality. This is a state that will make a mockery of democracy and deliberation. This is a state whose psychological principle is fear. This is a state that will make ordinary citizens cannon fodder for its warped nationalist pretensions.

>India has betrayed its own constitutional promises. India has many asymmetric federalism arrangements outside of Kashmir. This act potentially sets the precedent for invalidating all of them. How can we justify offering Nagaland asymmetric federalism but deny it to Kashmir? Its implication is that the government can unilaterally declare any existing state to be a Union Territory. This is a constitutional first. We are simply a union of Union Territories that happen to be a state at the discretion of the Centre.

The last 12 months have seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself calling the shots, through the president and governor, but the situation there continues to be even worse than it was when the BJP helped run the state government along with the People’s Democratic Party from 2015 to 2018.

>Make no mistake about this – what Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have unveiled on Monday is not just an assault on the unique place that Jammu and Kashmir enjoys in India but on the very federal structure of the Indian constitution. If they spent their first term in office undermining a whole host of institutions, Modi 2.0 will target the one institution that was still somewhat intact – federalism.

Writing in the [Indian Express |  We are just at the beginning](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/article-370-kashmir-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-govt-5880796/) Imad Ul Riyaz says

>My appreciation for India, and that of many other Kashmiris, and the desire to stand by it in the face of hostility and bullying back home, was sustained by the Constitution. Today, we are dejected, appalled and feel betrayed. The issue is not just about the abrogation of Article 370 — it is about the unconstitutional manner in which the exercise is being carried out, the way national and international treaties have been violated. Most importantly, it is about the manner in which the views of the people of Jammu and Kashmir were ignored.

Writing in the [Washington Post | Modi’s Kashmir gamble may be good politics, but peace should be the ultimate goal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/05/modis-kashmir-gamble-may-be-good-politics-peace-should-be-ultimate-goal/) Barkha Dutt says

>Yet this serious gamble for the future of Kashmir — which could either be a game-changer or set back peace-building efforts by several years — plays politically well for Modi and his home minister and second-in-command, Amit Shah. For one, it pleases Modi’s core base and delivers on an old promise (the ruling BJP’s manifesto had always promised to implement this). Also, with the exception of only a handful, most political parties have backed the government for what it has called the “integration of Kashmir into the mainstream.“

>The Modi government has scored a political victory. But will it alter the course of the 29-year-old insurgency in the Kashmir valley? One of the most worrisome aspects of the last few hours has been how the government has treated mainstream Kashmiri politicians as if they were anti-national separatists. Many of them braved great dangers and faced great pressure to contest elections and maintain allegiance to the Indian state. Weakening them further — one leader told me the latest move “reduces them to zero” — raises questions about who the government opens a dialogue process with should the time come.

So I thought I'd share a little background about the league. If you'd like to know more and follow more closely, you are always welcome to /r/IndianFootball for discussion, match threads, and everything else. 

#Background

Indian Super League started as a franchise football tournament in 2013, parallel to India's top division I-League. Now you might be wondering how can you have two top level tournaments in one country? Because we are India and that's how we roll! A little more background to the complications of Indian Football in [this detailed post by /u/EnglishHooligan](https://np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/7dki7h/201718_indian_super_league_guide/) from 2017-18 season.

#So what does it look like now?

Indian Super League has made significant progress in establishing itself as the top division league now. The roadmap is more clearer now. The league stage winners are eligible to participate in AFC Champions League (Asian equivalent of UEFA Champions League). With the inclusion of two of the oldest clubs in India, SC East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, ISL has firmly established itself as the de facto top league. Currently, the league is closed, but the season 2023-24 onwards, the league will have promotion and relegation. 

#What will current season look like?

This is the first large scale sporting event to take place in India after COVID-19. (Indian Premier League - IPL took place in UAE) Due to COVID-19, all matches will take place without crowd, in bio bubble at three stadiums of Goa. This is unfortunate for fans, but at least it's the resumption of football in India, so that's good news.

I'm 32 \[M\] and have have been seeking a life parter through various means since 4 years. I live in Mumbai with my parents. I am better than average looking, in good health, accomplished in my job, earning very well, people who know me find me helpful, non-smoker/ non-drinker and have a couple of hobbies that i've become good at. I'm not extroverted, but comfortable to talk with anyone. My negatives are that I am not a romantic person, I can become frustrated on small things specifically during challenging times (but I cool down quite easily) and I am quite laid back about life (not very ambitious). I belong to a financially stable family and my dad has a good reputation in the business industry (now retired), yet we live moderately and have a simple lifestyle. I have no siblings and parents are senior citizens now. Like a typical dynamic with relatives in most people's lives, only my mothers' family side are in good terms with us.

Here's my experience while seeking a life partner in past 4 years:

1. Only 1 relationship so far out of my own search - where the girl didn't have the courage to convince her parents. We parted ways eventually.
2. Following which, I have been in the arrange marriage alliance chaos meeting through marriage portals or middlemen. ̱Most of the times, I get rejected for staying in a 1BHK house  (even though we own it) and not having a car. Sometimes it's only that parents are interested, but girls aren't at all. Sometimes I reject if the girl has too many conditions or we seem incompatible or if she is one of the ""men have and still continue to oppress women"" types.
3. Despite all this, I've had 5 matches so far where the girl and I liked each other. In 3 cases (one of them through maternal relations), the fathers were unwilling to get their daughters married in Mumbai. In 1 case, my dad's friend brought forward her brother's daughter's' alliance (who's engagement once broke due to money demands from guy's end). But her parents did not like us because of \*drumroll\* our 1 BHK house, and only dad's friend was pushing things ahead and girl and I liked each other. And eventually the girl's father postponed the roka with vague reasons and it turned out to be because ""we weren't offering them show-off worthy jewellery"". I met the girl, explained and politely said we cannot proceed ahead. And in 1 case, I almost got married to a girl who's family was super desperate to tie the knots ASAP and I later found the girl had steep mood swings, had a history of fainting during work and her health issues never got clarified! I was an idiot here to even allow the quick marriage no matter what pressure.
4. We have never demanded nor favoured dowry. We are more interested in associated with a good family.

Now as a 32 year old man, I don't get alliances anymore. I had always been in favour of arrange marriages from known links, because I prefer the idea of clearing the needs and expectations between families. Love becomes possible when ""core"" needs and expectations are similar! However, I don't have this privilege. And it seems nearly impossible to find someone decent to date who isn't dating just for hookups! I genuinely want to settle down and have a family of my own. But with the current package of experiences, and the rise of pseudo-feminism, I don't know anymore. I am now unable to trust any stranger with no common links in between! And now as a last resort, I am exploring ways for alternatives to marriage and still live a good life with enough love around (although I am not very fond of this idea). After-all, we are all social beings and we all need a support system!

I even looked into single parent surrogacy and unfortunately it seems it's banned for single parents now.

I have informed my friends to keep an eye if they know anyone suitable. But I am not keeping hopes!

So folks who are acquainted with someone in a similar circumstance or someone who themselves are in such a situation/ or have moved on from this, can you share your experiences on how you got out of this? Or anything else you did to improve your situation? Please do make the comments useful, as I am sure there are more people who are in as similar situation (be it males or females) and it will perhaps help all of us!",False,AskIndia,"Why do you want to marry?

> At 3pm on August 13 2004, Akku Yadav was lynched by a mob of around 200 women from Kasturba Nagar. It took them 15 minutes to hack to death the man they say raped them with impunity for more than a decade. Chilli powder was thrown in his face and stones hurled. As he flailed and fought, one of his alleged victims hacked off his penis with a vegetable knife. A further 70 stab wounds were left on his body.

3. Check the document, and see for yourself all their hollow claims. The link at the end.
4. I am looking for lawyers. Got a lot of numbers. Talking to them right now. 
5. One good lawyer suggested I back out, sign an apology and end it, said will cost you 30k rupees only, and that's it. 
6. I won't back out. (Although my parents still don't know what mess I have indulged myself into. But I feel I will be able to handle them.)
7. Why did WhiteHatJr take this risky step? Like it seems like it won't go in their favor in public. Yet they took this desperate step.

<removed after Delhi HC orders on 24/11/2020 >



Neither the kids existed, nor the apps. And they really created a $300 million company around it.

If that is now fraud what it? Now I think now you can understand why the threats, why this case, why they are talking so much risk but not looking at their own mistakes. This proof was shared with one journalist but they ignored it. Now you can understand why the media was silent.

2. Hire a normal lawyer on my own and they would drag this case and make me exhausted.

Some requests:

1. PLEASE don't suggest me to contact Xyz, it takes time. Each email needs to be written accordingly. I would REALLY appreciate if you write emails to different journalist/YouTubers on my behalf. I am already running out of time. A lot has to be in the next few hours.
2. Some one please cross-post this in different subreddutts.
3. WRITE about this issue. Let's not wait for the media. I have posted most of the proofs on youtube and my Twitter. Please write blogs etc about this. Can someone also try to post this issue on LinkedIn, I am banned from there. 
4. Share etc do all that. You see how to spread this news now. Make a small poster kind of thing, those seem to work better than such long texts. 
5. I might not be able to reply to comments and DMs today, please don't mind.

Thanks again

I stumbled upon this report by [ABP News](https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1336260990845915143?s=21) that says MSP isn’t all that good either. 

- Farmers tend to grow only the crops that come under MSP
- India needs pulses and imports them from outside but farmers tend to grow rice and wheat only because it is covered under MSP
- each year, huge amount of farm produce goes to waste because government is obliged to buy it from the farmers no matter what the demand
- As a result this could be a burden for the tax payer 

While I understand there are literally thousands of places where the taxpayers money is gone to waste such as -
1. Subsidized food in the parliament 
2. Various allowances that are paid to government service employees like phone bills, travel trips every four years 

But, this MSP topic is current.


That brings up a question, shouldn’t farming be more tied into the demand-supply dynamics? What’s the point of growing something that you already have surplus of? Shouldn’t the government study the international demand and incentivize the farmers to grow those crops too that can sell in the international market for good price?

This farmers bill topic is so deep, the more I read about it, the more I get confused about what’s the right. With all that said, Farmer’s right to protest shouldn’t be taken away. With how bad Modi government has historically been with defining policies of this country, I doubt BJP has thought about this all the way through.",False,Policy/Economy,"How much of crop is purchased by the govt at msp.

For example - when I was younger in school and college - the vegetarians wouldn’t sit on the same table if I ordered non veg. 
Or they create an issue if someone advertises about non vegetarian food. 

It’s ridiculous, when did your religious beliefs give you the right to be intolerable toward others ? 

Doesn’t Hindu culture promote acceptance of all and live and let live ? 

What good is your abstinence of non vegetarian food if you’re just an asshole that makes people feel lesser because they’re different


EDIT - a lot of people are focusing only on the sitting on a different table part of the argument. But that was merely an example. Which hurt a 9 year old me. What triggered today’s rant was me being part of this WhatsApp group where someone advertised some non veg sushi & a lot of Jains / vegetarians were offended with it as they claimed such an advertisement hurt their religious sentiments 

So I proceeded to create another group where everyone was welcome and then they kicked me out of the first one.

Currently, his newest video exposes a call center scam and he's seen patrolling around it with a friend. He says that the owner is a really rich person with many connections (because he saw the call centers security team) and most likely has a connection with the police.

**Problem**

I see a lot of web-sites which are not designed well enough for even an able-person to use, let go of a disabled person, are active and being used day-to-day. And to make my concern reasonable and serious, the central and state-level **government maintained web-sites are not capable of handling people with disabilities**.

I think it's high time we raise this concern with the Indian Government as more and more processes and applications are getting online and visiting offices physically is not practical now a days. This will help 2.21% (2.68 crore people as of year 2016)[\[2\]](http://mospi.nic.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Disabled_persons_in_India_2016.pdf) able to perform tasks which can be done online, at least.

&#x200B;

**Solution**

[Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/) has come up with ""Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"" which consists of guidelines for a web-site to follow so that it can be fully functional to support people with disabilities and make their like easier.

353,How unethical/illegal is my doctor mom's behavior?,422,cy9zyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cy9zyu/how_unethicalillegal_is_my_doctor_moms_behavior/,169,1567373691.0,"Mom is a gynecologist by profession. She has ties with some Medical representatives (MRs) where they give her medicine to sell directly at rate cheaper than the shop. She then sells that medicine to patients directly or sends them to the medical shop. Shopkeeper gives her all the money sold from the medicines back.

 She once showed me a brochure which contained different gifts based on number of tablets written . It was a Plasma TV for something like 8,500 tablets but she chose something else.

She also does this thing where she sends a 50rs injection to the medical shop (which dad owns but rents out to others) and writes  a different injection name on prescription paper worth Rs. 5,000. Patient pays 5k to shopkeeper who then brings the money, injection back to her. 

She was really frustrated when they introduced compulsory attendance of certain number of medical conferences per year for doctors. Luckily, MRs get the certificates of conferences for her so she doesn't have to attend a single one! She stores some medicines directly in the medical shop that MRs giver her which she writes and the shop owner gives some commission to her for them.

 She has tie ups with a pathologist, where every patient she refers to him, he gives certain amount of money back to her (like 30%) from his fees. Once, she was showing me pathologist's report for fun to read. I found value of platelet written - 45,000 and underline under it. Normal value written next to it was 150k I think. She said without even looking its 450k, read again. I double checked but nope it was 45,000. She looked at it and got very furious. She immediately called the pathologist and said how dare he didn't tell her immediately and only underline it for her. She said that patient would have gotten serious if not died with that low platelet count. She said, she will instead send all patients to a different pathologist who gives her more cashback from now on if he does something like this again. 

Once a civil surgeon came to check her records and she had them badly incomplete. I remember she was facing removal of her sonography machine at least. Luckily, dad went to meet the civil surgeon few times and paid him around ~1L to keep queit. Mom was complaining how stupid these records are, how much work she has to already do. How unfair this all is on her.

Mom casually mentioned she failed final year of her MBBS but dad paid a lecturer to pass her. How her diploma doesn't mean anything because it is from a non certified organization; but it has the same initials as the official diploma so people would get fooled into thinking she has one.


GORE AHEAD - Parents Hospital is on ground floor and we live upstairs. Growing up, I used to regularly see different meat like parts in a regular dustbin, next to her operation theater. Once a stray dog was eating what looked like placenta from the dustbin. She would pay money to some midwife to dispose off fetuses and bury them into ground somewhere secluded. She was pretty mad when someone complained about her throwing bio hazardous waste in the surrounding area which did she used to do I think.

She reminds me without fail regularly how much money she earns and how many people recognize her outside because she is doctor. How much respect doctors get in society. She would say would say none gets as much respect as doctors do. Once we were going for a family vacation and a bike going at speed got slammed by a car right in front of us. I asked dad shouldn't we stop and help them, aren't you guys doctors and are supposed to help?"" Dad said, ""Who is going to spend that much time taking him to nearest hospital? The guy is probably very serious if not dead already."" So, we chose to continue to our trip.

E: I never meant it as some sort of PSA.  It was more of a venting from my childhood memories . Mom has been very abusive to me and recalling those memories; I have lot of amnesia around them and it is very stressful, anxiety inducing. Its easy to type these ones out because they don't involve me. 

Also they might seem clear to you guys, but I have lived in that home for 21 years. My first memories are formed  while living with my mom. This is quite the norm in my house and I was exposed to only these values, culture, environment most of my life. Parents wouldn't let me go outside much either, I was suicidal for a long time. I am very gaslighted from living with them. It feels really nice to know these things are very looked down upon and every comment helps with the gaslighting.",False,[R]eddiquette,"Unethical or illegal they don't care.

1. First, my first twitter id (@WhiteHatSr) got suspended.
2. Then my Quora got suspended for 15 days.
3. Then my video from youtube was removed for CopyRight infringements, whereas the video was of a balloon only. This is that video: [LINK](https://twitter.com/whiteHatSnr/status/1304298709916639232).
4. Then two of my Reddit accounts got permanently suspended, one for 'Harassment'.
5. Now all the 5 videos from my video got removed from YouTube for copyright infringements. How can I comment about WhiteHatJr and Byjus without even mentioning their names?

Byjus is not just a shrewd businessman he is running an evil corporation that neither cares about the mental health of students nor about their own employers. This kind of blanket ban on speaking against one person! Is this North Korea or what?

I have been making accounts after accounts and yet nothing can be said about him. Imagine how many lakhs of voices must have been crushed by his evil corp by now. The entire quora about Byjus and WhiteHatJr is filled with manipulations and fake reviews from fake profiles, each fake profile is from IIT, IIM, AIIMS, or an expert in AI, ML, or CEO of some BS. He is selling tags for years and none of the authorities noticed it.

(Whatever I have been saying since these couple of weeks, I provided proofs for that, and for this next thing I have no proofs as of now. But I have a STRONG feeling that his claims of him being IIM 100%tile topper twice at age of 18 and 20 when he gave the exams 'just like that' is also a FAKE BS Claim.)

This Byjus guy is just like Arindam Chaudhuri, that scammer IIPM guy. Every single thing about this Byjus company is fake. Their reviews on google play store (the video of which I had posted and they got it removed), their quora reviews from fake IDs, their claims of their 'extraordinary' products, their claims that their teachers are the top 0.01% teachers, their number of students who cleared IITJEE, NEET, CAT or UPSC exams (tbh they don't even declare these numbers clearly). Every single thing is a BIG lie.

Just yesterday Byjus acquired this BS company:

I am not a finance guy, but to me, this looks like he is doing some big-time scam with the money from his VCs. Not just that his product is bad, services are rude, their advertisements are immoral but there is something way shadier about this person.

I have a lot more proof about this company, there is a lot left to be shared.

Please follow [the youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJuE85w2kyFapd5_J9NDFPA) PLEASE (only one strike is left before the total ban).

I will post a video there sharing where will I be posting new videos from now onwards.

Indian Teams have previously had limited success but in 2020 despite the raging pandemic in India, **7 Teams won a Gold Medal (IISERs Berhmpur, Bhopal, Pune, Tirupati, IIT Roorkee, BITS Pilani - Goa & MIT Mahe) and 1 Bronze Medal (MRIRS Faridabad).  Along with that BITS Pilani - Goa won two special awards for Best Software & Composite Part and IISER Pune won the iGEMers Prize.**   


The competition has three lines (High School, Undergraduate and Overgraduate)  and several tracks such as Therapeutics, Diagnostics etc. Teams are given a kit of standard parts (genetic sequences coding for various things) and they attempt to solve real world problems using synthetic biology. There are various criteria laid down for Bronze, Silver and Gold which includes developing the project, consulting experts and people affected by the problem under focus, science communication etc. thus offering a complete learning experience and also aids in improving the reach of synthetic biology. The standardization of biological parts (BioBricks) has revolutionized the field of synthetic biology making it much more accessible and free.   


Note of thanks to r/India which has helped multiple teams at various points of time (directly or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly) with surveys, polls etc.

But feel free to discuss it. I'm more interested in how the cricketing media shares stories in your country, ie; is the absurdity of this story common?

I'd be especially interested in what it's like in India, because of the celebrity status many of your players seem to achieve. I'm from New Zealand, and I would guess that outside of Williamson, Taylor and Southee, maybe 20% of New Zealanders could name another player.

&#x200B;

**On the Kohli/Gavaskar/Sharma situation.**

From what I understand, from the follow ups on this story, Gavaskar's comment (which apparently was interpreted incorrectly by some twitter trolls) was just a statement of fact; not an offensive jab. To summarise, all that was said, was; 'During lockdown Kohli was only able to practice against the bowling of family members / non-cricketers'.

I think you really need a vivid imagination to think that is somehow offensive. Even if the comment came from a partially 'sexist place', I'm not sure there is evidence to reflect that, at all.

If he'd said something along the lines of 'Kohli was only able to practice against women during lockdown', then that's a different story.

Are similar stories told by the cricketing media of your home? And please tell me if I'm uninformed here; I don't know your culture well and am going by what other people have said online about this.

Today I walked in a little early at around 6 PM. When I entered the gym, the first thing I heard was an older lady telling me to get out. I replied excuse me, as I was genuinely confused. To which she pointed at the door and said get out in a louder harsher tone. This really irked me and I confronted her and asked her to talk politely to which she said gym has ladies time from 4 PM to 7 PM. I told her there is no such rule written anywhere and asked her to show me proof. To this, she replied to go talk to the manager. I told her since it's her claim, she should show me proof to which she said don't argue, just get out. I told her even I can bring a couple of guys in the gym and tell you, people, that this is gents hour if I don't have proof, to which she shouted even more loudly saying don't talk back and asked me to get out. I just scoffed and proceeded to walk to my workout station where she physically stopped me and said something like such mannerless youth come here nowadays. I replied saying, I am just asking a question, which I have the right to and proceeded to my workout station by walking around her.

I think this hurt her ego, and she went and called the manager. When the manager came, she told him I was rude to her and was harassing her physically (her claim was I pushed her and went) and her aunty squad was backing her up. In fact, this woman had grabbed my hand and tried to physically stop me from entering and now was accusing me of me abusing her verbally and pushing her. This is when I really wanted to whack her, but knowing how the law works it would have gone to her favor. Luckily, some other women in the gym stood up for me and said I didn't do anything but ask her for proof of the rule to which the aunty replied something akin to us accusing her of lying (which she was). When she knew she wasn't going to win this, she started demanding an apology from me, which I obviously refused. This is when she abused me some more and said something on the lines of aaj kal ke ye bacche and left while threatening me she will handle me later. I think that's when the manager realized the lady was full of shit. He then calmly explained to me about the new gym timing rules. I told him, if she would have politely asked me to leave and shown me the new rule, I would have left. I just confronted her because she was extremely rude to me for no reason. 

Dunno where this entitlement comes from in these old fucks. Just because they are old, they think they can get away with anything.

**Tl;dr: I was accused of verbal and physical abuse by some old aunty because I asked her a question and got saved by some women in my gym.**



**Edit: Manager took the blame in the end and apologized for that, to which I said that's fine. This rule was instated some 3 days ago and was apparently sent to everyone in the building Whatsapp group (which I am not a part of since my brother owns the flat). So the lady had a physical copy of the rule on her. But she didn't want to show it to me because elders should be listened to without any questions. I told the manager to please post it on the door or something so something like this doesn't happen again. I also told him, the only reason I got irked was that the lady was being really rude and downright abusive.**",False,[R]eddiquette,"I honestly think you need to go apologize and thank the manager.

My parents have been telling me to get a Govt. job because of the stability. They are of the mentality that even a LDC earns more than me currently, but I keep telling them that an LDC will remain in that field with no growth opportunities whereas my current job may offer me tons of growth.

2. Even though the initial pay in Govt. jobs are high (including perks) the increment is around 3% and an equal years of empolyment in private sector will give me better pay than Govt. job. (8th CPC may fix this?)
3. A Govt. job is very restrictive where in you cannot have any other source of income like blogs, freelance or a side business. You will be doing the same job for almost your entire life and even if you quit from a manager position, it is difficult to transition into the private sector.

I was a little afraid to post this because you guys are indians and might take offense to my post but I went ahead to post it because I want to hear your side. I am from singapore, we are developed and women have almost equal rights as men. I say almost because societally and in some rules that still exist, we're not given equal respect or rights but this goes two ways- meaning the same is true for men too. Anyway, I come from a very traditional family who moved from india. And my entire life has been about me being objectified and treated like a property by them in the name of the Indian culture and traditions and threatened with my future/ violence and physically abused if I don't comply.

They are christians and they still believe in dowry and arranged marriage (meaning during a marriage that is arranged by parents of both sides, the girl's family has to ""give"" a huge load of gold to the marriage and say ""hey, this is how much she's worth, take her and this is often a few $10,000"". They want the girl to do ALL the household chores. I remember days when my dad would end work earlier than my mom or be on leave and all he would do is lay on the couch or use his phone/ computer and not help out at all. Like why can't men help out too? No one likes doing it but it needs to be done! On the end, my mother wakes up at 5am daily to cook for the family while my dad gets up much much later. My mom is a community nurse and her job involves visiting patients from home to home and she is tired after work because she is getting old and traveling is tiring. Meanwhile, my dad works in a remote company with a chair to sit all day but he can choose to stand too. Considering all that, my dad does almost nothing at home and my mom exhausts herself 4x more than my dad. She thinks she is doing it for duty and he thinks he doesn't need to help because he is not obliged to.

I couldn't take all that was happening in my house anymore. Everytime I opened my mouth to say anything, my dad and brother would dismiss me and say my opinion is not valid, what they were really saying is I'm a girl and because of that I don't know anything, even though I did much better than my brother in school and I do read a lot and pursue knowledge a lot. Had they listened to me for example, they could have saved $8000 during home renovations. What triggered me to move out of my home was all that and forcing me to study and do things I do not want to and pressuring me to get an arranged marriage. I moved so I can study what I really want- web development and I have an internship now. 

Despite all that, my family still sees me as a failure and a disgrace. They don't care about my academic achievements or career. They even forced me to go to the cheapest university in the country and not let me go to a good university overseas (which i initially wanted). Meanwhile, they are paying as much as university would cost to my brother in polytechnic- it is an alternative path to study before university and an option that I never had. Little do they know, that their ""perfect"" son scammed them of $2000 by printing out a fake form pretending like it was from the school saying he has to go on a compulsory school trip to china for 1 month or he would lose out on credits and it would cost that much. It was a trip with his friends. He also smokes, drinks and does drugs- none of which I judge or condemn but I am mentioning because my parents would flip if they find out I did that. I cut him out of my life after he r*ped his gf (that was the final straw) and has no idea what consent is after he told me how he tried to kiss girls at the bar and they flinched and I told him he cant do that he needs consent and he dismissed me- we argued about it then I realised his view is as distorted and messed up as theirs and I would be better off without him

Today, I work and cook almost everyday- which to me is a huge thing and takes a lot of effort and energy. I know this because I went through a phase of depression where I was unable to do anything but I picked myself up again and I see that as an accomplishment now and progress towards my long term goals. I dont understand how traditional people like my parents and people who don't respect women like my brother can look down on women so much. If my brother was living alone, he would not be able to balance career with housekeeping and cooking as making time for friends (this last one I need to work on more), he would be spending more than me ordering food and not keeping the house tidy. They take us for granted and look down on us when we can do more than them and I dont mean this in a condescending or looking down on only all men way- ofc women like my mom encourage this kind of thinking as well- but rather we have different strengths and it is foolish to look down on women and suppress them when we can do so much. I'm not sure if I made sense here...what are your thoughts on this...what is this worshipping of men and treating women like less than men?",False,AskIndia,"You seem to have a personal issue , traditional views arnt neccasarily like you have mentioned.

**Update 1:** Father is diagnosed with Acute Leukaemia. Doctors says the amount in Pvt. could go 10 Lakh and in govt. Half of it. Other than that with the current information in mind the risk to save him is very very low as of his old age. There will be more test to confirm the type of Acute Leukaemia and after that they say it's upto us to start the treatment or not, keeping the risk in mind. I am really upset about the situation.

**Update 2:** Bone Marrow Biopsy is underway to accurately diagonse which type of Leukaemia it is, what treatment to follow, risk of coming back. And I learned about the whole Leukaemia thing and i predict it's possibly AML (myeloid). What i know about AML treatment, it itself is really expansive, needs a whole month blood products for transfusion, and sadly, the treatment itself is life threatening.

I recently asked the internet to help in arranging blood units. After getting 3 SDPs and some tests it is revealed that my Father (63) have Leukemia (Blood Cancer). We admitted him in MMI Narayana Raipur in the emergency (you could see my old post). We told our Diabetes Doctor that we won't be able to afford any kind of expensive treatments, the doctor too said she was upset about the situation and told that if we start the treatment in Private Hospital it will cost about 8 lakhs (which i cannot be sure) and recommended to take into Govt. Hospital. Tomorrow i will be talking about the current situation in detail with the Cancer Specialist Doctor that our Diabetes Doctor has referred to. I will take any decision after talking with the doctor tomorrow. *(i gotta be quick tomorrow)*

So, my plans are, to admit my father into AIIMS Raipur (Our Diabetes doctor said she will help in referral and management as much as she could) since we literally couldn't afford treatments in lakhs (No income source) even if i'll be able to arrange through my local relations, i can't say for high cost. Also Govt. Hospital system and management is the worst you could imagine. If i got to know that we could have treatment at affordable cost i am thinking about taking into Vedanta Balco Raipur (non-profit Cancer Specialist hospital) but i am unsure of their motives or about how much we have to spend there or whether they could take the best care of the situation. I will like if any of you who fully understand the situation and have knowledge of, to suggest what actions should i take.

It'll be good to know if someone has experience with Balco Vedanta and also about Leukemia. About how much it could cost or if we should just seek for govt. Hospital etc.

This is totally wrong and it is against my freedom of speech. I have full right to express my review of Byju's company.

*WhiteHatJr has been selling false pipe dreams of 150 crore INR salary to 6-year-old kids, and I can't express my opinion about that?*

*Reviews of WhiteHatJr on Google Play store are all Fake, copy paste, and repeat. Hey Google, how is that allowed and you are banning me? Under IPC section 416, fake reviews are illegal in India. Still, google play store isn't looking into it and banning my account for speaking this out loud!*

*This is the original video:*

*Hey Google, how can anyone use Barak Obama’s video in their ads and I can't even post a video of a balloon?*

At this point, the media was acting as if they cant listen to me, they started ignoring my DMs. And this was happening for 15 days already. Things felt really eerie from my end. Almost all the journalists were ignoring this issue. And trust me when I say every publication knows what's going on. I made sure to inform a lot of them. Even got to talk to many of them and in most of the cases, the story got canned by the editor. Byjus is sending them a lot of incentives to not publish about them. One journalist from a reputable publication (which runs of subscriptions and not ads) himself told me that Byjus approached them also and it was shocking for him. And when I asked what happened after that, he also stopped replying. And he knew I was getting such threats shown about for quite some time.

Please don't tell me this and that journalist to contact now, they know and they are ignoring. And the one I talked about above is someone most of you trust, which many of you have suggested me to contact, and some of you also pay for their subscription.

So that night was tough, I had to do something on my own. WhiteHatJr had crossed all the lines already so I also decided to get into the grey zone. The next day I posted videos of their slack channel and started tweeting about them. I have so much against this scam that they can be shut down multiple times now. YET, hardly any journalists have contacted me in the last 5 days. Two journalists did but what's the point if their editors would eventually scrap the articles.

If you want to help, PLEASE DO NOT SUGGEST ME TO CONTACT ANY JOURNALIST, BUT YOU CONTACT THEM, TAG THEM HERE OR TWITTER. But please don't suggest the obvious things. Time constraint is really a bottleneck for me, I have to handle many platforms alone.

And my situation hasn't improved much. My brother has a job now in Gurgaon but he cannot possibly support all of us.

My family's problems started long before the pandemic. I had to drop out of high school because of my family's severe financial problems and the deterioration of my own mental health.

Now my father's money is running out and in December he will no longer be able to pay the rent of the place we're living in right now. After that we will have to live in the streets like beggars since we do not own any property of our own, in Guwahati or in any village.

I'm a guy who has the ability and the smartness to do any decent job, I just haven't passed my 10th grade(I am still trying to pass it, it's only because of my mental struggles I fail). I can't get a job because I don't have any educational qualifications. So if anybody can offer me any job in any city so that I can keep surviving, I will be forever grateful. I'm begging you all. Help me. I do not want to live on the street and starve to death. I can shine if given the opportunity.

Please help me.

Edit: A lot of people are willing to help me out, some even offered me a job. A few are willing to contribute to a crowdfund so that I can buy a scooter and become a delivery boy. I will discuss with them and start the crowdfunding. I will of course explore the other options as well since I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket and regret it later. But overall, I am so happy that people reached out to me and are willing to help me during my darkest hour. I will never forget the kindness of the people on r/India.

Syed Ahmed Khan had several fatwas put against him for his radical ideas of having young Muslims enter then modern society. Allama Iqbal, who is now considered a founding father of what is modern Pakistan, wrote extensively in his poetry and his critiques about this schism between his humanistic values and his love for what he saw as Islamic humanistic values, and his problems with the backwardness of Islamic society and the values it laid on things - Taking Issue, Allah's Answer and A Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam.

There is definitely that feeling of progressiveness in a lot of empathetic people who feel hindered by their religion but are also raised with a deep respect and love for their faith and are critical of those with hidebound and farcical views, yet they cannot set aside their religion even though they might feel adrift from the vast sea of people who feel completely different.

526,Seeking help for building support & awareness for a separate time zone for the North Eastern part of India,190,k39uud,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k39uud/seeking_help_for_building_support_awareness_for_a/,25,1606687362.0,"I have spent lived most of my life and have done most of my travelling in the western half of the country, geographically speaking.

I moved to the North East around a year back in the summer months. The most drastic change, bar none, had been the time of the Sun rising in the morning and the Sun setting in the evening. And now after more than an year, I am still not accustomed to the Solar Cycle here and get depressed every evening seeing that it is already dark outside by the time it is time to leave from office.

The reason for this is the fact that India has one single time zone for the whole wide country where we have a longitudinal extent of around 29° from our westernmost state of Gujarat at 68°7′E to the eastern most state of Arunachal Pradesh at 97°25′E which is 2933 kms.

This difference of around 29° longitude, amounts to almost 2 (!) hours of difference between the sun setting or the sun rising at the two extreme points of India at 4 minutes per degree longitude.

Now, the difference between where I am living now, and where I have grew up and have spent most of my life, is around 19 degrees, which when calculated at 4 minutes per degree longitude, amounts to 01 hour & 16 minutes, which is huge, and has thrown my whole circadian rhythm into whack.

Now this is only a personal scale, for a single individual, when this is extrapolated to the whole easternmost half of the country, imagine what losses a single time zone must have caused psychologically and financially generation on generation due to the multiple hours of wasted daylight, loss of productivity and no synchronization of circadian rhythm with light–dark cycle.

---

Historically in the North Eastern states, both [civil](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/one-india-two-time-zones/article17653169.ece) & [political] (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Gogoi-for-separate-time-zone-for-Assam/articleshow/28252502.cms) society have been demanding and campaigning for a separate time zone.

The former Chief Minister of Assam, the late Tarun Gogoi, had also suggested/ campaigned for a separate time zone for the northeastern states which would have been ahead of the IST [by at least an hour to 90 minutes](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-could-get-second-time-zone-with-assam-one-hour-ahead-546592).

In fact the famous Chai Bagans of Assam, have been using their own informal time zone since before independence, known as the [Chai Bagaan time](https://www.vahdam.com/blogs/news/assam-tea-gardens-have-their-own-time-here-s-the-story-of-bagan-time), at IST + 1 hour helping them maximise  their productivity.

An [article published in Current Science Journal Vol. 115, No. 7, 10/10/2018](https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/115/07/1252.pdf) by authors from Council of Scientific and Industrial Research–National Physical Laboratory (CSIR–NPL), Dr K. S. Krishnan Marg, Lakhi Sharma, S. De, S. Panja, P. Arora, A. Agarwal, T. D. Senguttuvan, V. N. Ojha and D. K. Aswal (director of NPL) who are also in Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-NPL, propose an implementable solution that puts the country into two time zones:

> 1: IST-I (UTC + 5:30 h, represented by longitude passing through 82°33′E) covering the regions falling between longitude 68°7′E and 89°52′E, and
> 
> 2: IST-II (UTC + 6:30 h, represented by longitude passing through 97°30′E) encompassing the regions between 89°52′E and 97°25′E. 

Their research carries weight as the authors are from CSIR-NPL which functions as the ’National Meteorology Institutes (NMI)’ for India being the signatory of ‘Metre Convention,’ and is [responsible for generation and dissemination of the IST](https://www.nplindia.in/time-and-frequency-metrology-section) as the official time keeper of India.

This is a great paper demonstrating the necessity for 2 time zones showing implementable solutions and also showing the benefits once such a proposal is implemented. However I am attaching their summary here too:
    
> In this article we have shown that the two time zones, namely IST-I (UTC + 5:30 h) and IST-II (UTC+6:30 h), indeed are a requirement of the country. The demarcation line between IST-I and IST-II passes through the border of West Bengal and Assam and falls at longitude 89º 52’E. The states falling under IST-II would be Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunanchal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and, Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Implementation of IST-II in these states would not only enhance the efficiency of populace as their daily working hours get synchronous to the circadian clocks, but would also save significant amount of energy. The rest of India remains under IST-I. Technically, the two time zones in the country can be easily implemented by CSIR-NPL as it has the desired mandate and the expertise. 

There have been many debates in the political, civil & the scientific community for the need of multiple time zones in the country, but as it stands today, there has been no visible progress towards implementation.

Any change to this end is only possible with better awareness between the general populace of the country and a serious political will at the centre.

---

Now, this is where I wish to discuss with you people, the possibility of giving implementation to an idea that I have which I think may help demonstrate and build awareness the need for multiple time zones and hopefully inspire action towards creation of a separate timezone. 

Many of us may be familiar with the website [WindowSwap](https://window-swap.com/) that come up during the initial months of quarantine. It is a great website showing a  view from different windows world over by having people record and upload 10 minutes of view from their windows an submitting to the website.

Inspired by the above website, I had an idea to build a website, which on its landing page will have 3-4 different panels side by side showing live view from different locations demonstrating the extent of difference in Solar time from West to East of the country. Additionally with each view labelled with the time difference between the IST and the Mean Solar time at that location.

I imagine this could help provide some perspective visually to people from different areas and help understand and appreciate the importance of having a time zone as synchronised as possible to the local mean solar time.

Now the big stumbling block I have here is, I have absolutely zero idea on where to start on building such a website as I am computer programming illiterate.

So I am throwing this idea to the community for your help to figure out if such an idea is even feasible and how can I go about implementing this. As this would not only take building the website and purchasing hosting space, but also volunteering of at least 4-5 people to share live video feeds form the different parts of India say from someone’s terrace, a park, a market area etc. I have searched some public webcam feeds too but there are no good feeds available for India, if at all, that may be considered useful.

Hoping for some help and guidance.

I started smoking when I was in ninth grade. And before I knew it, I was hooked. From a couple a week to a pack a day then quickly to nearly 25 cancer sticks a fucking day.

*(For the record, I'll turn 24 this year)*

I knew this was literally killing me. Worse, it was killing my family. My mom and dad. The people who've sacrificed more than I or you could fathom, to give me the privileged life that I live today. Their smiles vanished as they stood helplessly, watching their son smoke his life away.

I was too ashamed to hug my father because I fucking stunk of smoke all the motherfucking time. It was taking everything away from me. I tried to quit cold turkey many a times but couldn't last longer than 1-2 days. But then somebody suggested nicotine patches. I was extremely skeptical at first. But I bought a month's supply.

I received the patches on 9 August and started the very next day after throwing away my lighter and tearing all the cigarettes that I had left. And guess what? It fucking worked. Before I knew it, a week went by with the patches. But then a fear started to grow within me. ""What if I get hooked to the patches?"", I thought to myself. And after 7 days of using the patches, I started day 8 without any patch. That was 17 August. And till date, I haven't used any nicotine product.

Before you ask, yes. I still get urges from time to time. But instead of giving in, I just look into the mirror and tell myself

# ""I am not a smoker anymore.""

Edit- What im getting at is, most of the stuff people do at funerals(atleast in my region) is to ""show"" others how much they care(even if they genuinely dont care someone died).

Just think of a simple birthday of a colleague.   Introspect on your own behaviour. Do you really care when you say 'Happy Birthday', do you care about the present, do you eat at the birthday lunch/party, .... if you do this to people you care & not care, dont be surprised if people you dont care about (and who dont care about you), come to your bday party to have a good time on the freebies.

I borrowed 50000 from credit card company and enrolled my pet to the coding session. The trainer lady taught coding jargons with lot of passion. She told, many dogs learnt coding and become millionaires by selling their  apps. My dog started salivating, hearing that.

I was not sure, whether it was worth my investment, months passed by, there was no visible change in my pet.

FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich made a decision to give gold medals of FIDE Online #ChessOlympiad to both teams - India and Russia. More details & an official statement to follow.

Edit: The first round was a draw. 2 Indian players lost on time in the second round; this was attributed to a global outage that also impacted chess.com.

To clarify, FIDE ruled that Humpy Koneru, Divya Deshmukh, and Nihal Sarin all had their games impacted by the outage. They then counted up all the other completed games (which were all draws) and declared the result a tie.

581,Indian Rape Laws that Need a Change,182,k5cdpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k5cdpy/indian_rape_laws_that_need_a_change/,97,1606955008.0,"I think we can all agree India's rape situation is less than ideal. Even if we are scoring well on the official stats, there are more than enough reasons to suspect worse things are happening behind the cover. I think these are some of the laws/things we definitely need to update to solve at least some of the problems.

Laws we need to add:

**Marital rape should be recognized:** Marriage does not mean infinite consent.

**Rape of males should be recognized:** Rapes involving a male victim is more common than you think. Also, these are a lot more underreported than rapes involving a female victim.

Also, we need to get rid of these laws:

**Age of consent should be reduced to 16:** The age of consent currently is 18 which is unreasonably high. We need to lower this or have some sort of ""[Romeo and Juliet](https://marshalldefense.com/blog/romeo-and-juliet-laws-and-the-sexual-activity-of-minors/)"" clause to ensure sexual activity between consenting minors isn't being automatically criminalized for no reason.

**We need to get rid of the "" pretext of false promise to marry"" law:** This law hurts more people than it protects and is almost impossible to get a conviction out of. Not to mention it makes little sense.

**Criminalization of consensual sexual activity by parents needs to stop:** A surprisingly large percentage of reported rape cases were filed by parents who disagreed with their daughter’s consensual sexual activity. This is a result of our society's premarital sex taboo and has no clear solution. One solution would be to make it so that the victim's statement should always be allowed to override the parent’s statement.

In 2013, about 60% of rape cases in Delhi fell under one of these laws ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_India#/media/File:Verdicts_in_Delhi_Rape_Cases,_2013.jpg)). These obscure laws flood our courts with unnecessary cases leaving less room for rape cases that deserve more attention. Not to mention the unnecessary suffering these cause.

These law changes should also make it harder for someone to frame someone in a false rape case which would restore many people’s trust in our justice system and make it easier to convict on the victim’s statement in absence of other evidence.",False,Policy/Economy,I’d agree with all your changes except for the marital rape one. That one will just overload the judicial system and cause far more problems that the rape on pretext of false marriage one.

I'm not an active fantasy league participant per se, but I know people like to create their own teams and I thought this could help.

I wanted this to be a one evening effort, so please let me know if you guys think something could be added or improved. For one, the sheet does not have a column for the batting/bowling style of the players, because those were json objects and I was a little lazy creating a separate dictionary for them, and also because those details are usually found on fantasy league apps/websites while choosing players.

Hear me out. When Covid started, the Indian govt had the worst lockdown in the whole world. I remember it was in the top 5 on the Stringency index in the world. What happened was a lot of people died because of the incompetency of the government. Do you remember the videos of people walking on foot? Or the videos where they had to walk on the railway tracks because of the police? Or the news when so many of them were killed by the train? A ton of them had to borrow money later to take the train to return to their villages. Other countries also had lockdowns too, but they didn't abandon their citizens to die.

While other socialist countries paid their citizen 60% of the salary or something like that, the Indian govt launched ~~atmanirbhar~~ **bhagwan bharose** scheme. It basically means fuck you. You are on your own now. All the TV channels are promoting it like retard instead of demanding actually support from the govt. It's a pandemic and we are a socialist nation. What are we paying taxes for, if we can't expect support from govt during a pandemic?

One time, they refuse landing permission to a flight full of stranded Indian when it arrived at Indian airport? Tell me which other sane countries do such shit. Now they also have restrictions on domestic air travel just to extort money. You need to pay for govt quarantine when you travel by domestic flight, but you can spread covid as much as you want if you travel by road. Does it make any sense?

Now, they are behaving as if covid is over. It's not. Govt is behaving like this since August. Earlier when we had 100 covid cases, we converted trains to quarantine rooms. But when we have millions, we are behaving as if doesn't exist. Hospital full. Data intentionally absent. In my hometown, they banned covid testing. I know because I had to apply for the test for travel reasons but all the labs told me that CMO has banned COVID testing. If you die of covid, the report will say anything but covid.

While Europe is in the second lockdown, Indian is relaxed like we are the most developed country in the world with the best infrastructure and hospitals. If European countries are out of hospital beds and ICU, how come we have a ton of free beds? Rules are jokes either. No masks, fully crowded markets 7 days a week. Gatherings?

in western countires agriculture is so concentrated that only a few families own large farm lands and farming equipment. Due to this, they have a very high influence on the politicians to pass farmer friendly bills. They donate extensively to the campaign of politicians. There was a report of how americans are paying a few dollars more each year for corn syrup because of the lobby. Same is the situation for all agricultural products.

There is so much news to digest around the vaccine that I am genuinely lost. First up, there are several candidates & how which one gets the nod notwithstanding the storage feasibility and all, the question that I want to focus on is, ""When & how will the Indian people be vaccinated?""

Snippets from all news reports/feeds that I have seen at least:

1. \*\*The government never said that all Indians will get the vaccine.\*\**Funny. A certain election promise was that the party if voted to power, will get you the vaccine*
2. \*\*The government aims to vaccinate 30 crore high priority people by July 2021.\*\**Okay. That makes sense that the people most at risk get it first. Hope that the people that make the cut are genuinely high priority*
3. \*\*Phase II will cover 80 crore Indians (\~60% of the population)\*\**When? How? Which?*
4. **The SII says that the vaccine should be available in the private market (for e.g., for corporations that wish to get its staff vaccinated) by March 2021/April 2021***So, if I don't make the cut of the 30 crore high priority Indians, can I get the vaccine in May 2021 from a private label? Sounds wrong. Also, who will regulate the cost and the genuineness of the distributor? Imagine the black market then*
5. **The UP government has been ordered to get its vaccination process ready by 15th December 2020 to vaccinate 77 districts***What alternate universe timeline is this?*
6. **The Delhi government claims that it can vaccinate the entire city of Delhi in 1 month***I am lost*
7. **How will the government make efforts to ensure if someone is vaccinated or not? I mean, is Aadhar compulsory? And how can I trust that the person that I am meeting is vaccinated or not apart from their word for it?**

The more I read, the more scared I get that this is going to be handled as well as demonetisation was. The people involved might have everyone's best interests at heart and I know that this is a defining time that is new to a lot of people. But, we as a country have seen the impact that bad communication or partial communication can have on people (ref: long queues outside stores when the lockdown was announced & the whole migrant movement then).

A middle class person's life is shit compared to a middle class person in a foreign country. What we would call middle class; certainly would be >20k/ month income which would put you at the top 30% of th- nah just kidding. It would put you in the top 3 fucking percent of the population which means 97% which is literally fucking everyone is poor as shit. 

If you are in a metropolitan city and made the mistake of fucking breathing, \*poof\* your lifespan went down 10 years! Festivals like bhogi in the South where you, get this, **burn plastic waste** don't help either. Then we have retards claiming havan which is burning stuff (pretty massive red flag) **reduces air pollution.** 

The roads are dirty and people who lecture others to not litter spit and litter the roads themselves. No one bats an eye and this shit goes on every single day.

&#x200B;

**Secondly : Education and business : I**f you are okay with living 10 years less, that too amongst people who believe that havan reduces pollution or are blind BJP, and pseudoscience (looking at you, Sadhguru) followers, this one will most likely change your mind if you are a student and are in general category.

Now, reservation in India you might have heard is capped at 50% but as luck would have it, my state specifically is an exception and has 79% reservation. On top of that reservation for women is being added. By the time I'm gonna finish my education reservation would be 110% which is so dumb.

You might think I should stop slacking and that if I work hard enough reservation wont matter. However, reservation gaps are really high, talk 50% in some colleges and in **extremely extreme** cases, an 94% gap. The general cutoff was 94%. No, this isn't a typo, general cutoff 94% and 94% gap does mean that the SC/ST cutoff was **0%** in a fucking PHD in mathematics in Delhi University in 2017. 

On top of that, we have shithead politicians who are striving for 100% cutoff.  This shows the government doesn't care about talent and just wants votes.

&#x200B;

**Thirdly: Taxes:** Even if I come to terms with not getting admission in college even though I scored 94% more than someone who got admission, having my lifespan cut by 10 years and political discourse being a he-said she-said shock value propoganda contest, this is the nail in the coffin.

The mean income in India as I already said is shit but even if I manage to get a good salary, where would my taxes go? In countries like Canada it would go towards free healthcare which helps people who can't afford it and in other countries, it would go toward infrastructure development in low income areas and wellfare programs. 

However, in India, the taxpayers money would be used to fund the next scandal, to buy the next member of parliament or to fuel propoganda against minority communities. I don't want to contribute a penny toward this and this is the ultimate reason I want to leave India.

I would appreciate if someone could give advice to move to a better country like the US, Australia, Canada, UK etc. Please DM me or leave a comment.",False,Non-Political,"> pseudoscience (looking at you, Sadhguru) follower

To build a case against a money-loaded corporate company who has ability to have access to best legal team with one click, a little bit of political correctness, high moral ground, wise usage of words and smart comebacks while being lawful is necessary.

Next time, the media interviews should be avoided or scripted or just say -

>""My lawyer has advised to not comment on a few things, but rest assured the truth will prevail.

**EDIT:**

Instead of referring to Slack, he could have said this:

>Mr. Bajaj has himself admitted that they used a fictional persona of a kid to fool parents. Also, he may have raised a women issue saying ""Pradeep is defaming women teachers."" There is evidence showing showing Karan or his team making misogynistic comments. I cannot share sources of such evidence on this news channel but they will be presented at the court.

**EDIT:**

Regarding Poonia's words ""housewives"", he should come out and justify that housewives can be educated too. He can say:

>If the company thinks housewives are any less educated, that means they are undermining crores of Indian women / housewives who are well-educated. However, when I used the word it was open to interpretation. I was referring to those that do not come from a technical background to be able to teach coding. They read out a script given by WhiteHatJr. I had a problem with that hence I raised the point. My statements had no intent to defame the company, I was simply stating the facts in black and white.

**Whatever I write is not legal advice and it shouldn't be taken as final. It is just a starting point and work towards making it fool proof and undebatable.**

Then learned a little about their hiring process. Even if you don't have a background in computer science, it doesn't matter.

It was definitely after seeing Pradeep Poonia's post that I realized this contribution helps to the case. Teachers just memorize the whole script and at places where it lacks they can just conjure up anything because they are teaching kids at the end of the day. I don't have a problem with them teaching this to kids, but the fact that even one sessions' document is 50-pages long with such descriptive illustrations and such goes to show how these people aren't giving these pdfs to anyone specialized in the field. Even the GitHub accounts linked were fake, I tried searching for them and they don't exist now. All the video links in the pdf are also unlisted.

I was working with Pankti Mehta from Forbes India on an [article](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/take-one-big-story-of-the-day/whitehat-jr-and-the-curious-case-of-disappearing-dissent/63627/1). 

*Forbes India* reached out to both WhiteHat Jr as well as YouTube India with detailed questionnaires on Wednesday (October 21) around 3.30 pm 

I received three emails from YouTube Copyright between 5.59 pm and 6.28 pm. 

Each of the emails now said, “The complaint lacks one or more legally-required elements of a copyright takedown notice, so we asked the requesting party to provide additional information to complete their notice. Pending their response to our email, we reinstated your video(s) and resolved your copyright strike”. 

[Earlier it was 'unclear' to them.](https://preview.redd.it/pdvk29xs21v51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3f852f0ab2d1cd32eb12335ef0c1fc57a5ce3e7)

&#x200B;

Points to be noted: 

1. All of my appeals had been ALREADY rejected by YouTube stating "" it's unclear to us whether you have a valid reason for filing a counter-notification, so we won't be able to honor your request"".
2. Youtube reinstated 14 videos within a 30 min time span, from TWO diff YouTube channels. AND the reason they gave was that they didn't get a reply from the complaint. But all the videos were removed on different days, how come the deadline of reply from complaint all the 14 videos was right on eve of 21st Oct.
3. My Videos from the third channel arnt taken down by Byjus/Aiplex/WhiteHatJr since [Ken Article](https://the-ken.com/story/byjus-silencing-of-online-dissent/) got published (6th Oct). And the same videos are taken down from other channels (there are people who help me by uploading the same videos on diff channels).
4. Video of the kid mentioned in the Forbes article, Jihan Haria, is banned on his channel, and its WORKING on my channel! Why?

Enough of their bullying, I won't hesitate now in saying what's obvious. Someone in the YouTube India office is corrupt and eating Byjus biscuits. For a month I was tagging YouTubeIndia over twitter and NOT ONCE they replied to my tweets, whereas they usually reply to others such complaints. 

This issue is not now just about the WhiteHatJr scam, but it's getting deeper, on how a couple of corporates are dictating freedom of speech over the internet. We have enough proof showing how Byjus control Quora. Recently when I posted about WhiteHatJr female director harassing me with false allegations, that article was also taken down from LinkedIn. This dictatorship needs to stop. And time has come to straighten them out. 

ALL VIDEOS which WhiteHatJr and Byjus have taken down by now must be unbanned. Every single video, along with apologies from Karan Bajaj ('certified' from Discovery and 'Google'). Admins I want to create a post with a list of all such videos, which I will keep on curating and updating until we make Byjus unban every single such video. Guys, if you know such people/videos please do send me the link.

I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.

So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words. 

Name of boy - Ivaan

Most of the comics are restricted to topics like girlfriends, exes, insulting IITs, insulting audience and women comics often make period jokes. I mean, that's what it all has come up to. When aib and EIC were at their prime, they had a variety of content, comics like rivaldo, Kunal were doing political jokes, while Zakir Khan was into comedy about dating scene.

https://preview.redd.it/ectct4kd9yz51.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=75e07b5b01bfe2e82f7f170da5f1917ab3678c25

### Tl;dr

Today we wrote to the Delhi Government urging against mandatory imposition of the Aarogya Setu app. Our alarm bells were rung by a circular issued by the Excise Department which directed licensed wholesale liquor vendors to ensure mandatory use of Aarogya Setu by every worker. In our representation, we have called upon the Delhi Government to withdraw the circular issued by the Excise Department and we have also sought issuance of an advisory to all departments clarifying that use of the Aarogya Setu app is purely voluntary and no person should be denied access to goods or services for failing to use the app.

### Background

The Aarogya Setu app was launched by the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology as a proximity exposure notification app on 02 April 2020 and it has been mired in controversy since its release. Concerns have been raised about misuse and breach of sensitive personal data collected by the app and legal experts have cautioned against deployment of such technologies in the absence of a data protection law in India. Public health experts have also[ **explained**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-multi-domain-joint-statement/) why such apps cannot substitute on the ground contract tracing by healthcare workers and questioned the government's failure to explain why information available through existing databases is insufficient. Finally, technologists have [**warned**](https://internetfreedom.in/kerala-hc-hears-challenges-against-mandatory-imposition-of-aarogya-setu/) that Aarogya Setu relies on weak anonymization techniques which make its users susceptible to re-identification and [**criticized**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-should-be-open-source-now/) the lack of transparency surrounding the app's code and algorithms.

### Stop the Voluntary-Mandatory Game

The central government has repeatedly claimed that use of the Aarogya Setu app is voluntary but ground realities paint a very different picture. We have been closely tracking mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu by different institutions including [**airports**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-air-travel-survey/), [**court complexes**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-delhi-district-courts/) and [**resident welfare associations**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-rwas/). Most recently, our alarm bells were rung by a circular [**issued**](https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/delhi-government-makes-use-of-aarogya-setu-app-mandatory-for-wholesale-liquor-vends-staff-in-delhi-165270) by the Delhi Government's Department of Excise on 27 October 2020 which directed licensed wholesale liquor vendors to ensure *“mandatory use of Aarogya Setu app by every worker.”* The circular further stated that Bond Inspectors are required to ensure compliance with this direction and submit a certificate within 3 days.

In our representation, we have called upon the Delhi Government to withdraw the circular issued by the Excise Department mandating use of the Aarogya Setu app by liquor store workers. We have also sought issuance of an advisory to all departments of the Government of NCT of Delhi clarifying that use of the Aarogya Setu app is purely voluntary and no person should be denied access to goods or services for failing to use the app. In support of these demands, we have highlighted the following concerns about legality and effectiveness of the Aarogya Setu app and explained how its mandatory imposition could lead to privacy violations and exclusion.

### (IL)Legality

Despite collecting sensitive health and location data of millions of Indians, the Aarogya Setu app lacks any legislative basis and powers have not been provided under any statutory instrument to mandate use of the app. In an [**interview**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aarogya-setu-app-mandate-illegal-justice-b-n-srikrishna-6405535/) with the Indian Express, Retired Justice BN Srikrishna who headed the Committee on Data Protection constituted by the MeitY has endorsed this view and stated that making use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory without enabling legislation is completely illegal. Mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu amounts to an infringement of fundamental rights of citizens because it could lead to privacy violations and exclusion, and therefore, such a measure must be supported by legislative authorization.

### Inaccuracy and Ineffectiveness

In addition to these legal concerns, mandatory imposition of the Aarogya Setu app may prove to be counterproductive at achieving its intended purpose of reducing COVID-19 transmission because of the inaccuracies inherent in app based contact tracing. Apps like Aarogya Setu rely on Bluetooth and GPS signals which cannot accurately estimate whether someone has been in close proximity (6 feet or less) of a COVID-19 infected person, and this can lead to a high number of false positives and false negatives. For instance, Bluetooth signals cannot recognize physical barriers such as walls and floors which make virus transmission impossible, and therefore, they may misidentify individuals as COVID-19 positive and send the authorities on a wild goose chase. Similarly, since Bluetooth based apps cannot account for surface to person transmission, they will also yield false negatives and provide a false sense of security to infected individuals.

### Past Central Government Practice

It should be noted that authorities of the central government have also recognized that use of the Aarogya Setu app cannot be made mandatory for workers. For instance, on 01 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued guidelines which made use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all public and private sector employees and the head of an organization was responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the app among all employees. After this decision was challenged before the Kerala High Court, MHA [**issued**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-victory/) revised guidelines on 17 May 2020 which encouraged use of the Aarogya Setu app on a ""best efforts"" basis but stopped short of making it mandatory.

More recently on 22 August 2020, MeitY launched an Open API Service to enable employers to receive real-time information about the risk status of their employees, customers and users. However, the [**Terms of Service**](https://openapi.aarogyasetu.gov.in/tandc) of the Open API Service clearly state that explicit consent of the user is necessary to access data collected by the Aarogya Setu app and alternative methods to avail a service must be provided to users who do not grant such consent.

835,Using Python to Expose White Hat Jr: Fake/Duplicate Reviews on Play Store,1114,k8edvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k8edvw/using_python_to_expose_white_hat_jr_fakeduplicate/,50,1607366618.0,"**TL;DR**: 3.73% of White Hat Jr reviews are fake/duplicates and a lot more are very suspicious. Code attached at the bottom.

&#x200B;

I was browsing White Hat Jr reviews a couple of hours ago and noticed an awful lot of them seemed to repeat over and over again. To confirm my suspicion and as I had also seen a few screenshots from [u/pooniahigh](https://www.reddit.com/user/pooniahigh) with the exact same text in two consecutive reviews, I decided I would write a simple program that checks for duplicate reviews.

So I wrote it and tested it for the WhiteHatJr app (com.whitehatjr) as well as the GitHub app (com.github.android) and the output gives me two conclusions-

&#x200B;

*(Statistics only account for reviews in english)*

&#x200B;

**WhiteHat Jr (com.whitehatjr)**

&#x200B;

36.96% (2081/5630) of 5 star reviews are exact matches

&#x200B;

3.73% (210/5630) of long 5 star reviews (3+ words) are exact matches

&#x200B;

**GitHub (com.github.android)**

&#x200B;

13.42% (89/663) of 5 star reviews are exact matches

&#x200B;

0.0% (0/663) of long 5 star reviews (3+ words) are exact matches

&#x200B;

* AT LEAST \~4% of the longer reviews for WhiteHatJr are fake/duplicates. (I say at least as this program doesn't use any string similarity algorithms, it checks for the exact same text so even if 1 character was different it hasn't been counted).

&#x200B;

* WhiteHatJr has a LOT (\~3 times) more 1-2 word reviews like 'nice app' or 'good' than the other example. These may be fake as well, but the evidence is inconclusive.

&#x200B;

Code:

    # pip install google-play-scraper
    from google_play_scraper import Sort, reviews_all
    import json
    
    review_list = reviews_all(
        'com.whitehatjr',
        sleep_milliseconds=50,
        sort=Sort.NEWEST,
        filter_score_with=5
    )
    
    review_list_json = json.loads(json.dumps(review_list, default=str))
    review_content, frequency_dict = [], {}
    duplicate_total, duplicate_sentence_total = 0, 0
    
    for i in range(len(review_list_json)):
        review_content.append(review_list_json[i]['content'].casefold())
    
    for i in review_content:
        frequency_dict.update({i: review_content.count(i)})
    
    for k, v in frequency_dict.items():
        if v > 1:
            duplicate_total += v
            try:
                if k.count(' ') > 2:
                    duplicate_sentence_total += v
            except:
                pass
    
    print(f'{str((duplicate_total / len(review_list)) * 100)[0:5]}% ({duplicate_total}/{len(review_content)}) of 5 star reviews are exact matches')
    print(f'{str((duplicate_sentence_total / len(review_list)) * 100)[0:4]}% ({duplicate_sentence_total}/{len(review_content)}) of long 5 star reviews (3+ words) are exact matches')

Note: I am by no means an expert on this so feel free to correct me if some/all of the information was incorrect.

Edit 1: As suggested by [u/bhiliyam](https://www.reddit.com/user/bhiliyam/), here is a 3rd stat (duplicate long review/total long review) in addition to (duplicate review/total review) and (duplicate long review/total review) ->

&#x200B;

**WhiteHat Jr**

7.01% (215/3064) of long 5 star reviews (3+ words) are exact matches

&#x200B;

**GitHub**

0.0% (0/464) of long 5 star reviews (3+ words) are exact matches",False,Business/Finance,"Not defending WhiteHatJr  - but this test gives misleading results, which shouldn't be taken at face value. 

The sample size for WhiteHat reviews is 5630, which is around 9 times more than the sample size for GitHub which is 663. This makes it more likely for the WhiteHat reviews to have duplicates, just by the laws of statistics. Just like in a school register with 1000 names, you will likely find more students who share the same first name than in a class register with only 100 names. 

Assuming a standard probability of 0.0005 that two given short 5-star reviews are identical: 

Average number of duplicates for GitHub(683 samples) = 96 or 14.05 %

Average number of duplicates for WhiteHat (5630 samples) = 1545 or 27.4 %

This shows that you would expect more duplicates reviews in the WhiteHat review sample, even if there was no tampering of reviews involved - simply because there were more reviews tested for WhiteHat than GitHub. 

Of course, the data showing 36% of identical reviews for the WhiteHat app is still much higher than the expected 27.4 %. So maybe there is something more to investigate there. 

None of this is meant to discourage OP in any way - keep up the good work! The data is useful, we just need to be careful with how we interpret it. "

The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

Getting to the topic, here's a Privacy 101 for you if you're a Journalist /	Activist / Citizen of India who doesn't want her/his private chats on live TV.



**Privacy Violations and How to Evade:**

**1. WhatsApp Chats:** Regardless of claims, WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted and it cannot be Intercepted and decrypted without the encryption key from the user's device. The encryption key is stored in the app data folder which is only accessible to the app itself and the root user and a few other methods due to android's app sandboxing. The privacy flaw lies in the Google drive backups and the owning company Facebook. Facebook is known to violate user privacy and it's not once. The WhatsApp chat databases (msgstore) are uploaded unencrypted into Google drive. Google drive has a special feature for storing app data in a hidden folder in the drive (App Data Storage), anyone with Google credentials or a login session from Google services can access all your chat backups and read it without a key. 

**[?] How to Prevent:** Disable Google Drive Backups. The local backups are always available from Internal Storage /WhatsApp folder. The backups are encrypted so you can just copy it over to a safe location (a hardrive / pendrive / cold storage). You can also use any of the below cloud storage apps and configure automatic sync for the folder. 

**2. Call and Message Tapping:** This is usually the telecom company handing over their logs to the government on orders. Your telecom company may also monitor your internet activity by monitoring your dns queries or using DPI (Deep Packet Inspection).

**[?] How to Prevent:** Use a different number. Ask a trusted friend to get you a Sim card, and use it for account verifications and then don't keep it. You can also purchase temporary numbers online. Just change your number altogether, or use online privacy focused messaging and calling services. Do not visit HTTP websites as they'd be plain text. Use a tunneling tool like TOR with Encrypted DNS. If you dislike TOR for it's slow network, use a trusted VPN like ProtonVPN.

**3. Using a VPN make me undetectable:** NO. A VPN only tunnels your internet through their servers, preventing you from DPI and interception threats in your network (Lan, Wan, and from your ISP). Many VPN providers are known to have ""Zero Logs"" policy, but it's not known how much of it is true as their servers are private. They could hand over your internet logs to your government any time on orders, or just sell it. 

**[?] How to Prevent:** If you're into a sensitive activity I'd recommend using TOR for it. It's decentralized and no organization owns it. It routes your traffic in layers (circuits) through different self hosted servers (TOR nodes). No one on the Onion Network knows each other. (you might have just heard of it as deep web in fancy articles. It's called onion router in particular, nothing just a bunch of ip addresses. People just like fiction a lot).

**4. These apps make me a ninja online:** NO. It's you who make yourself a ninja. Keep in mind these are just tools. Your Privacy is no one's, just yours. How you handle it is your responsibility. Using real names, aliases, common passwords, typing practices, phone number, pictures, it's all you who control it. If you can make good practices, you can become a 21 century ninja.

**Using privacy focused applications and services always come with a little separation from comfort. You would have to walk that extra mile yourself for that little megabyte of data. Read u/demo_crazy's comment for more overview**

**Keep in mind, using an iOS or a Mac is always great, you wouldn't require most of the apps in such case. In case you're still sus, you can find these apps for both iOS and Android.**




**Quick List:**

**1. Messaging:** Ditch WhatsApp (it's not really trustworthy). Use Signal. Its completely open-source. For more privacy use burner number. (you can also use wire and telegram).

>Instead of using burners(which surely isn't easily available in India) and then using Signal, try **Threema**. It is open source messaging app which requires no phone number to sign up.

**2. Email Client:** Use K9 Mail App, FairMail, and ProtonMail App for writing emails. K9 Mail and FairMail are email clients that support gmail and Outlook and other email providers.

> K9 Mail with OpenKeyChain is to be used to be more secure(even if you use K9 Mail with Gmail Google can scan it). Also use something like Disroot or Dismail instead of Gmail. Better to go with Protonmail or Tutanota all in all to be most secure and they have there own apps. 

**3. Email Provider:** For emails I wouldn't recommend Gmail, Outlook or Yandex. It's better to use ProtonMail and Temporary Emails. For more privacy you can use TorMail and other onion mail services.

> You can use Protonmail or Tututanota via there onion addresses instead.
>Do not use Gmail or Outlook. If it is confidential, use **Protonmail**, **Tutanota**, **Disroot** as email providers. Also, using Gmail with an open source mail app is pointless.

**4. Twitter Client App:** Talon and Twitalatte for twitter. They are open-source with no adverts.

**5. Cloud Storage:** It's not recommended to use Google Drive for things that may be sensitive. Use Tresorit and Mega Cloud for your private suff. They also have android apps and have automated folder sync.

> You can use any cloud storage (better to go for mega as said) but make sure you encrypt the content using something like cryptomator before uploading.

**6. Contacts:** Open Contacts is an awesome tool to manage your contacts that are sensitive. You can import export them as well. You can then use cloud storage apps to sync it. 


**7. Messaging:** Use Silence. It will encrypt the content of message if both parties are using Silence. But SMS is the least secure of any communication modes and it's vulnerable to all kinds of attack. QKSMS is also open-source and a good alternative if you don't need encryption. 

**8. Browser:** Firefox or Tor Browser, with duck duck go search engine and UBlock Origin, NoScripts, Https Everywhere Adblock Plus plug-ins. Ditch Chrome and UC please.

**9. Internet:** Do not use a VPN. Use Tor instead. It's decentralized, open-source and nearly untraceable. If you really need a good VPN use ProtonVPN or PIA. Use Orbot App to tunnel all your traffic through Tor. You can use Invizible app for overall private tunnel.

>Also, use a VPN for important stuff. Use **ProtonVPN**, it is free, based in Switzerland and does not keep logs. 
>Use **DuckDuckGo** or **SearX** for search engines. 

**10. Be Cautious:** These apps won't make your data private, they will help you, it's you who needs to be cautious.

>Use **Openboard**, **AnysoftKeyboard**, **Simple Keyboard** for keyboard apps. Open source and do not track your key taps.

>If you're using any of Facebook owned apps (FB, Whatsapp, Instagram) use Greenify, Hibernator to force stop them which won't allow them to run in the background.


> Ditch anything from Google. If you using Android, install a custom rom, like Lineage OS, AOSP, or Graphene without Google Apps. Use MicroG. 

Just use iOS, it's great at privacy. A de-Googled android is kind of equal if used right.

> Another suggestion which applies to journalists, Make use of securedrop for any kind of whistleblowing or sharing your jouranlism data to others. Securedrop is a really active project and it helps journalists all over the world in sharing files securely.

Even the D610 (Nikon’s entry level full-frame) or even a DX camera like the D7500 has amazing low-light performance these days, and digital essentially encourages you to take more photos and experiment with settings so you have a better chance of getting that perfect shot.

A camera like that (or equivalent Canon offerings), and then shooting in RAW and using Lightroom to tweak your images, can give you amazing results.

Realistically, this workflow (DSLR, RAW, Lightroom) is used by most pros today, and there’s a good reason for it.

At this point the difference between what film and digital can practically achieve is pretty small. (See Steve Yedlin’s work in Knives Out for example — done in digital, but looking like a Nolan-esque “shot on film” movie. Although of course that’s from the world of cinema not photography.)

Fair, that's genuinely great, but the vast majority of people in India right now and even plenty of Indians abroad do not come from backgrounds that could even remotely be described as 'progressive'. I am talking about everyone else, who are not quite as lucky. I make my case:

1. It encourages coloursim and viewing members of the opposite sex as objects and resources. The lighter-skinned a woman is, the more options she has- education, personality and other preferences be damned. The more money a man makes, the more options he has. Women are viewed as free house help that also has to look pretty and fuck her husband and risk her life having his babies while men are...literal banks. When you are choosing your spouse from an online catalog (matrimonial sites) the way you'd shop for furniture, you cannot take chemistry and personality into account.

2. It is a recipe for disaster in a culture that stigmatizes divorce. My parents met each other in person twice before their wedding. TWICE. 2 times. I would vet my fucking *roommates* better than this. Neither of them had any idea what they were in for and now they're stuck together and have been for 30 miserable years. I cannot recall a single time they were genuinely happy, nor have I seen a single happy couple in my family except for one- an aunt who was basically disowned for marrying a man of a different religion, and her husband.

3. It is sexually regressive. If I'm being real, anyone traditional enough to marry a stranger because their astrology charts match up is not going to be good at discussing sex. Does the man even know what a clitoris is? Does he care (likely not)? Do they have similar, or compatible views on porn, open relationships, cheating? Are the couple even aware sex should be pleasant and not painful? I know women who aren't even aware that it's not wrong for women to *feel horny*, let alone masturbate or have sex. This is traditional, 'typical', non upper-class Indian society.

4. It promotes insular societies. People will not marry outside their religion/caste/social class in arranged marriages. Why? They are either afraid of people different to them, or genuinely think they're inferior. I think that loving somebody, whether romantic or platonic, is the highest form of accepting their humanity. If you cannot accept that someone of your caste/religion/etc. loving someone of another is not a sin or transgression, then how non-discriminatory are you, really?

This is off the top of my head, but I have a lot more. I remember being 15 or 16 and crying in bed at night thinking I only had another decade (if lucky) to live before having to look the possibility of marrying a stranger and having to bear his babies in the eyes.

What is everyone's opinion now? Should educational institutes re-open for professional courses (engineering, medical, business courses e.t.c) ? What is your experience of online academics? Would you prefer online education over in-person class?

IMO, online education is a complete mess. There is no planning, no one is ready to listen to students' side, and everyone is given sub-par scores, because according to professors, ""StUdEnTs CaN CoPy tHe AnSwErS"". It makes no sense to pay full fees and study engineering from home.

If these people are so caring, then why don't you guys live on the 5 kg of rice given by government throughout your life and give others opportunities to better their lives. Fucking selfish retards can't do shit. Not everyone is a fool, and everyone has a different meaning to live. 

When people believe in god, scientists and geniuses call them fools and talk about natural selection. But now, when people want to live a normal life, these geniuses advice to social distance and avoid gatherings. Don't know where these geniuses get their logic from. If hospitals aren't overwhelmed, there shouldn't be any lockdown.

If you are afraid, stay the fuck home and wait for a vaccine, let life and people who want to, move on. "

&#x200B;

EDIT: Though this is a bit off topic, i feel it's still related and therefore felt the need to add it.

Foreign work phobia-

In India, at every step, from school to at the house, you are told that if you go work for another country you are a deshrohi, that if you dont pay taxes to the government to help them fund their next MLA bribe, you are worthless.

I'm speaking for experience here, in my Hindi classes, we would have essays giving galiya (insults) to people who don't work in India where you cant breathe the air without reducing your lifespan by 20 years. 

This does 2 bad things:

1) The quality of life of people is shit and talented people aren't motivated or don't feel the need to innovate because of the aforementioned reasons.

**2) THE MAIN REASON:** Talented people, namely in the field of web development don't find employment in India and work freelance, which doesn't help with the next unicorn startup. Even if they work with a startup, their talents are undervalued. They are underpaid as fuck (13$ a month for building actual ready to release apps). People dont invest in the web development circle as it's very expensive compared to shitty INR.

All these culminate in the lives of Indian talents going to shit. People like Sundar Pichai and Satyela Nadir would be working a shit 30 thousand rupees a month job if they didn't move out of India. These people are brought up as proof of work life in India being okay, but it proves the contrary.",False,AskIndia,"Umm yeah...

Before innovation comes a country copies stuff.

Look at china they used to copy almost anything and everything from manufacturing to branding to applications now they have a great production capacity ,research quality and innovation.

I don't see copying as a problem if this can further nurture industry to grow towards innovating. "

But they are still putting down videos of other people, in a much more aggressive and rampant manner. If your videos or posts go down, please let me know about them. I want to keep a track of every single content they are taking down.

So when they couldn't put down my videos, they restored to harassment. I started getting messages (from WhiteHatJr teachers, mutual contacts between me and WhiteHatJr) that I must back out before EOD else they will file a defamation case against me. This felt real and tbh intimidating to some extent.

Then from WhiteHatJr One Lady Director (let's call her WOLD) started giving me legal threats over LinkedIn. She claims I somehow harassed her. I took my elder brother's suggestion to not reply to her threats and kept doing what I was doing. So for 6 days, I didn't reply to her comments. But she just didn't stop, started calling me *'a coward', 'a\*\*', 'doesn't have guts'* for not replying to her comments.

I somehow stayed calm and didn't respond to her threats. She kept saying she would file a case over me for defamation and harassment, and that I will get a legal notice in a week's time.

Meanwhile, Karan Bajaj, CEO of WhitehatJr posted two articles on LinkedIn, in both, he tried to divert the topic and ignored all the questions and concerns that were raised. He basically used his daughter's example to point out that coding is a good tool to enhance learning (no one objected to coding as a part of the curriculum) and in the second one he gave the example of his mother, an army officer's wife, a total emotional route he took there. And somehow justified all the false advertisements of WhitehatJr.

There were some people on LinkedIn who were opposing WhiteHatJr and suddenly they started talking nice things about WhiteHatJr. This was alarming to me. I saw how they were trying to press the issue and move on. And on my posts, WOLD kept instigating me. She even made a new Twitter account to push me more, she kept saying she will file a complaint against me kept calling me a coward.

Finally, I confronted her over LinkedIn comments and told her that I am not scared of her false allegations. I said I am waiting for your legal notice, **TO THIS SHE SAID "" I am letting you go on Humanity grounds'.**

For an entire week she threatened me, bullied me over LinkedIn and Twitter, their teachers called me 'dog' (yes they did), their trollers started calling me 'Pakistani guy' over youtube comments. But when I faced her she had no reply! IN FACT, she started tagging LinkedIn and Twitter telling them that I am bullying her by tagging her in comments.

This was too much for me to ignore. I collected all the snapshots of her threats, made an article on LinkedIn, documenting how she bullied me with her threats for an entire week. AND GUESS What happens next?

My article went down from LinkedIn within 8 hours! AND she disabled her LinkedIn account.

I reposted the article ALONG with the proof of how they suppress dissent, a snapshot of a post by WOLD on Workplace telling their 13k teachers to report my post. This is how they tackle dissent by attacking like a mob, putting baseless false allegations, threatening, and bullying, getting content removed like it's nothing.

Till now they haven't replied to a single question of mine.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAQ: Why am I doing this?

Won't go much into my personal life. In short:

* Kota Coaching life. I know what happens there. How aspirations are turned into a rat race. I have also seen Bansal Classes, the most formidable institute of its time going down. Whitehatjr and Byjus are nothing in front of that.
* IIT. Did it even though I never wanted to do engineering. I like other subjects more. Society makes people run after silly tags.
* Software job. I know no one gets a 150 crore salary, I also know coding cant be learned the way WhiteHatJr is trying to teach. Maths and coding cant be learned by spoon-feeding. Only intrinsic desire to learn it can make someone a good coder, not extrinsic rewards such a salary or tags. WhiteHatJr will just create a huge crowd of below-average coders who won't even be employable.
* EdTech Company experience: 8 months of exp (2017) in one such EdTech company showed me how ugly this sector is. There is no education and no tech, only sales and marketing. CEO of that company clearly said in a meeting ""we are not in the education business, we are in money-making business"". I left that company then.
* UPSC preps: I know what kind of depression follows after such failures. I missed Interview calls twice by a single digit, one time by 9 marks, and next time by 8 marks. I feel I have seen the darkest days and somehow came out of it. As an adult, I think I can comprehend how it would feel to a 13-year-old when his/her pipe dream of 150 crore salary (just like wolf Gupta) would break. Teenagers are most prone to depressions. WhiteHatJr can put an entire generation into life long depression.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PS: Hey WhiteHatJr, I used WOLD and not her name because of the Reddit rules, not scared of you jerks.

Am I hypocrite or it's just like we eat vegetables, use wooden furniture meanwhile also want to protect forest and trees. Can we say that comparing chicken and dogs is like comparing vegetables and trees. I don't know, share your opinion.",False,AskIndia,"No, chicken and dogs are not comparable. Chicken are domesticated for the purpose of  eating it, or eating it's eggs, while dogs were the primal hounds that used to help us catch these delicious pheasants/chickens. Dogs are our companions. The whole idea of being vegan is stupid. But people say there are health benefits. Of course there are. If you eat 20 pounds of meat everyday and then sleep yo ass off, you gon get fat and die of heart disease. So who the fuck is stopping you from exercise?   
It's okay if a lion eats a deer, or when a male lion kills lion cubs to assert dominance. But when we do the same, it's immoral. What logic is this?  

Ok I was joking, but the reason why it's immoral for us to do the same is because, we can think, and the lion cannot. But that doesn't mean we are not part of nature anymore. Sure we can think, but we have to survive, an a surplus of food is what we need. Stop all the meat production, and the arrest everyone who sells meat. What happens is that the farmers lose money, can't afford to keep the domesticated animals and have to kill them all(or maybe the animal lover will take care of millions of them, costing them something like 2 trillion dollars every year). And we lose a huge amount of food on top of that, which can't be practically compensated from veggies alone.   
My request to you all, eat meat, and exercise.   
Don't be vegan, it's a stupid, and potentially dangerous idea. "

a few weeks ago I saw a stray cat whose head was half-open, filled with maggots. he was laying under the shadow of a tree, I called every single vet I could find on google, they all declined for help. The one genuinely lovely guy gave me the number of a few NGOs. Almost all of them didn't pick up or were closed. at last, someone agreed to help the cat, he was taken and then admitted.

In my neighborhood, it's normal for kids to kick, beat up cats, throw stones at dogs. they are repulsed by the thought of an animal living in the locality. I've seen people throw hot water at them, kids stepping on their tale and beating them with a stick. I try my best to stop them. the tragedy is, as much I tell them to be nice to them, it makes it even worse. Their family complains about it to mine, then my family tells me if I like them so much, maybe I should invite them to my bed and take a nap with them. The irony is these people are the most religious people I know of.

I would be lying if I said, I didn't want to beat up those kids, but I can empathize with what it's like to feel pain, unlike them. 

at this point I'm helpless, there's no one I know who shares the same affection for the animals as I do

You guys have any tips or suggestions then tell me. (I'm planning on moving as soon as I can)",False,AskIndia,"i really find these type of posts to be hilarious. 

bruv, you wanna see violence against animals, try visiting some animal farms on the outskirts of any major city or visit your local butcher and see the condition of the chicken and the cages they're kept in. try looking at the way sheeps and goats are raised or better yet, search for a thing called veal. 

while i do understand your concern and share your pain as someone who raised few pets, the cats and dogs in cities have it much better than pigs on a farm factory. "

On 25th of July this year I bought a laptop from official Acer India estore for 50k. I had to buy the laptop from their estore as I was not able to get the laptop with the specific configuration that I need from Flipkart or Amazon. Paid the full amount.

On 30th July I received the system and lo and behold there was a gapping in the bezel of the laptop. I turned on the system and the system used to crash while trying to go to sleep. I immediately called their helpline and they told me to email to register a case. The lady on the line suggested that there might be software issue and to update the drivers and created a case for the gapping in the bezel.

I immediately told them about their return policy which in clearly written on site that they should be informed about within 7 days of delivery. These guys refused to replace or refund me on my system. They said the system will be serviced. I sent them countless mails and calls and no one listened and they proceeded to fix the bezel of my laptop.

Meanwhile I had updated the system to the latest drivers and the issue of system crashing had not solved. The service center took the system and formatted it and told me the issue was solved. I checked and the issue was not solved. Their tech from somewhere in India even remoted and checked the system and saw that the system was updated.

In the meantime I stilled called support number and they said to get a DOA certificate from the service center, the service center blatantly refused as it ""not their policy"". Then I talked so some head in Delhi and he says that DOA can only be processed if its reported within 7 days of invoice date. WTF! the invoice date is 25 the date of order and 30th is the date of delivery, what kind of policy is that? But still their site states 7 days from delivery but these thieves are still not providing me with a replacement laptop.

To this day the system is with the service center and they call me saying that the system is fixed. When I remote and check via Anydesk, the system had crashed. It clearly is shown in Event Viewer.

Its been 4 months and nothing is still happening. I have put my grievance in National Consumer Helpline and no action has been taken. I bought a system to work on and these people took my money and I have nothing in return for 4 months. What gives? I had bought the machine with my 5 months stipend and these people have no heart!

These people are hell bent on giving me a defective and factory refurbished machine which it has become.

What should I do?

Advice for Shoppers, never buy electronics from dedicated brand stores. Always get from a online dealer like Flipkart Amazon etc  or offline dealer, never a brand shop.

**Update 1**: Found e-mail & numbers of multiple people involved in Acer, called multiple persons. CEO's number was unavailable but sent him an e-mail. Automatic e-mail came he is out of office till 8th January 2021 next year and told me to contact his assistant for urgent matters. Sent to her. No response.

Next I sent mails to the highest authorities in the company and started calling people from top down to bottom. Head people didn't pick up my call. Regional Manager of North picked up the phone and acknowledged my issue and he said that he'll look in the matter. He said to wait till Monday for a promising update.

Next then during daytime I received a call from technical head of region and he's saying that he's asked the service center to send the machine to him and he'll fix it personally. He's offered me with a warranty extension of 4 months on the machine but is still is adamant to fix the machine.

TL;DR I'm still being bullied by the company. I am not getting my refund or replacement on my order.",False,AskIndia,". >I turned on the system and the system used to crash

I could have told my parents and they would have sent another one, but I took it personally. I cannot break their trust.

I sold 10 booklets, that is 100 tickets. I went from shop to shop, on foot, pitching the party to youngsters and the uncles. They bought it happily.

This broke my Internet -> Home networking, and was hoping that IPv6 could help me sort this out. 

I reached out to ACT, but they keep calling me, and given the pandemic situation, I haven't been in a position to take their calls. I requested they reply through email, but to no avail. I clearly requested IPv6 details (roadmap, implementation etc.) but they replied like so.

>We would like to inform you that in order to connect the network from outside you need to take static ip. Kindly confirm us so that we can forward it to the concerned team for immediate action.

I'm not sure what to think, do the technicians know about IPv6? I've seen some threads that point out the ill-trained support team, but at no point did they escalate this. 

Now, I do not have a twitter account to ping them over there, nor am I keen on setting up a server to VPN into my home, as in that case, I'll need to pay for the cloud-VM ingress-egress bandwidth usage.

Why do we need relatives?
So that they can use you and do nothing for you in return.

###
Case 1:

My aunt's son wants to move into my house forever because he started working.
I'm ok with him being in my house for a short time before you find a place but dude he doesn't think he'll ever find a pg. He even said that I expect you to help me with my travel expenses for everyday and my food. Of course he forgot the shelter. I'm like dude why are you working then? 
I'm ok to support if you're in dire need. But not these entitled idiots.


###
Case 2:

My another aunt wanted me to take care of their house relocation and when I did whatever they asked me to. Like getting the house cleaned, getting a transport company and taking care of some of their relatives you'd expect them to thank you. But no fck you because we're entiled we want you to leave your day job and take care of stuff. Get angry on me and complain about my perfection. I loved and respected my aunt since my childhood but it was all gone in a few minutes.
I grew up poor not dirt poor but poor enough. Today I make a decent living. When my father died at age of 10 and when we were poor nobody was there for us. We survived on rationed rice. Nobody asked what we ate. 
When my mother and wife were hospitalised these people who’re expecting me to help weren’t there.
Now that I have some money and moved into a decent house they want my help. It's cute when these people talk about realtions and family. 
These relatives looked down upon us because of our status. Now f*ck you before you expect something from at least be reasonable.
Now I don't believe in relatives anymore. You learn your leasons.

###
Case 3:

My wife’s sister stayed with us during the entire lockdown and did I mention her friend too? We were like that’s ok because we’re not able to feed the migrants lets at least feed these girls who are by the way working. No problem with it at all. But this lady my wife’s sister goes back to her hometown and tells that I’m an idiot. She says I asked her to give my personal laptop when she was wait for it watching movies with her friend. 

There are just a couple of relatives who were there for me when I needed them and I’ll be indebted to them.


Thank you for the rest of the relatives. But I don’t need you anymore.

###
Edit:

I knew this was relatable for every family but didn’t think it was so common. 
I think keeping these relations transactional is the best. You help me I help you. 
It would be unfair if I don’t mention that my relatives helped me with money when my mother was hospitalised. But it was because she took care of my grandmother while none of her children cared about her. But it was a nominal amount and I didn’t ask them for it. I didn’t have insurance back then so this situation happened. It was purely transactional. In person support is way more valuable than money.

###

UPDATE

So this cousin from case 1 just got ego hurt when I told him it was wrong of him to ask me money for travel when he's making 20k a month and I told him that it's risky for my senior citizen mother to live in the space when he's using public transport and should find a space after intial few days.

These are some key points:

1) There are two mid-semester exams in each sem taken by our college. Till last semester it was computer based mode but from this semester itself they have made it pen-paper mode. Though they have given an option to skip it and directly give End Semester exams (ESA) with an increased weightage, but it's still all in OFFLINE MODE. Best of two offer for the first time has been announced for college for students giving ISA, leaving us in dilemma to go to campus or not. 2nd ISA is currently happening in campus.
Labs have also been made offline.

2) ESA is scheduled in December MANDATORY IN OFFLINE MODE. For the namesake of giving option, they have given us a chance to either give it in December or in next semester along with that semester exams. It is almost impossible for a student to give 2 semesters' exam together. So practically it's not an option and forcibly all of us have to give exams in December in campus. 

3) When most other colleges have much before declared that all of their college activities would happen via online mode, PES has chosen not to even consider the option. A huge number of students study here and from all across India which makes it very difficult as well as risky to go to college.

4)  Since August, Hostel Management have taken decisions that are not student-friendly. Today most students have paid the hostel fees and are in hostel right now. No SOP is being followed in the hostel, students are sharing rooms, attendance daily and mess coupons distribution weekly through queueing or grouping. No social distancing is being followed/enforced.

5) Consent form is being taken from student's parents but the form is very unclear. It talks about classes but not exams however, the exams are the issue. College clearly wants to force people to make a decision but not have any liability on themselves. 

6) College is allowing students to enter even WITHOUT COVID TEST report. People are even producing month old tests which college is encouraging/ accepting. There have been numerous incidents where students are gathering as they believe college is taking precautions. There is no enforcement of Social Distancing either.

7) Covid Testing was done on the college campus in one location with no social distancing. However one student from that area has tested positive and many students are yet to get their results, yet college is still allowing them to write their exams. The college has been completely ignorant about the fact and does not respond to us. 

8) Since a long time, we students are trying to contact our college management and convey our concerns. But each time they neglect us. There has been minimum communication whereas, during a pandemic, it should be ample. The only communication is a monthly live session where they have a one-way conversation with the students. 

9) Parents and students have sent mails across to our higher management as well which have been ignored. There has also been a case where one student received a reply in error where the pro-chancellor has asked the faculty to ignore the mail and ""move it to spam""

All these things have led to a lot of fear among students and parents. It is adamantly clear that the management is not following the SOP's in place and therefore are putting our health at risk. 
 Students have to travel all across from India risking their lives just to write exams when there is an alternate option available (online), which is being taken by other colleges. The Covid situation in Bangalore is not very good. We have seen and even have photos of people gathering in college but college authority takes no action regarding it.
The entire student community is very tensed right now. People living away from home are afraid of what to do if something were to happen to them. 

The entire student community of PES UNIVERSITY stands by these points and want to know what exactly can be done!",False,Coronavirus,[removed]

A quick update since the last post.

* ASCI didn't respond to any of my tweets. The whole [news about ASCI taking down WhiteHatJr](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/special/exclusive-advertising-body-asks-whitehat-jr-to-pull-down-ads/63767/1) was to mellow down resentment against WhiteHatJr and give them a fresh clean slate. Their actions of giving WhiteHatJr an easy escape in case of false advertisement is getting more suspicious. They didn't respond on

1. Why only 5 ads were objected
2. What about the rest 100s of false ads
3. Didn't show the email threads regarding their complaint to WhitehatJr.
4. Didn't tell if they asked who is Wolf Gupta.

ASCI is not a govt body, as it might sound. It's a self-regulation body run by corporates themselves. So kind of their own front to give themselves clean chit when in trouble.

&#x200B;

* A 2 min video of mine asking questions from WHJ teacher finally go viral. Thanks to all the people who contributed to our telegram channel. Got a good SM traction. Things were moving strong on LinkedIn. A LOT of people supported the cause, mostly techies who with a good understanding of coding, who knows the harms of pushing kids in such a rat race.
* Karan Bajaj does a post last evening (4th Nov 2020) around 6pm-ish and calls us a 'Troll' . He wrote ""*A troll works hard too but to tear things down to gain fame, followers, and perhaps fortune. Destroying value and lives in the process.*""
* I didn't respond to his BS. Although at once I got very angry I decided to not play by their rules and keep my focus on more solid proofs. Finally, I didn't comment or anything under his post. For many people who did, their comments got deleted.
* My LinkedIn account gets banned at midnight, around 6 hours after Karan Bajaj calling me a troll.

Now.

1. Karan Calling us a troll: Have you ever seen a CEO acting like this? He also said I am doing this for 'fortune'. So the one who is making $300 million for scamming gullible kids is doubting my intentions. Apart from losing 11 kg in 2.5 months and gaining 27k Karma on Reddit, I am not making a dime here. You guys know my intentions. If anyone still doubts, go to my Reddit posts, scroll down, go to the first posts and see I was posting against Crypto scams as well 3 years back.
2. First, they banned my videos on YT, Quora account, Twitter Id, LinkedIn posts, Panzy Saran tried putting false allegations of harassment on me, and finally, my LinkedIn account goes down. And YET I am a troll and Karan Bajaj is a saint for looting innocent Indian parents.
3. I tried to not make this public because some of my family and friends are also watching this thing getting unfold, I didn't want them to worry. But it's high time I must talk about the msgs I get in DMs.  Ex and current Byjus employees tell me that I must be worried about my physical safety all the time now. A journalist and a good friend told me I am being watched. And even my phone number might be getting tapped. One other journalist told me that I must prepare a dead man switch.

[Such msgs are regular these days. And hence I am living in a safe place alone.](https://preview.redd.it/x4kglhj24fx51.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d21192c868b8637d98a7bdbfda5f00f1adcee2b7)

4.  One of WhiteHatJr employee (the ones who makes fake profiles all the time on Twitter and tries to do fake +ve reinforcement under my tweets) crossed all the limits. He dared to abuse my mother. And I know these scums would be lurking around this post as well, so listen carefully, I will find out who you are and will make you apologize.

[I will SSLY make you apologize.](https://preview.redd.it/4iyl6cuvefx51.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97714a0ab82b1b281d6c8ab1a6c0058aff66c317)

&#x200B;

5. I am still working on the list I talked about last time. I will try to find out every single post/video/tweet/article that was taken down by them and then try to get every single on them reinstated.

6. I have updated most of the journalists in my contact about the potential danger to my life, but seems like it's trivial for them. They are waiting for something to happen. Live Mint recently was doing an article on the WhiteHatJr issue and I was working with one of their good journalist Salman. But in the last hours, the article got canned. This has happened with 4 other publications already in the last 30 days.

&#x200B;

Now this time it's time for YOU to **ACT**. You guys do something, write a post on LinkedIn, ask Karan Bajaj why my ID was banned, why his people are falling down to such low levels and abusing my mother, why isn't he answering any single questions.

The ENTIRE tech community is on our side, how come we don't have a say in how coding must be taught to kids. On one side there is the experience of lakhs of years of coding and engineering and on the other side there are a bunch of greedy VCs who wants to make a circus out of our entire educations system, putting lakhs of kids into the danger of life long depressions, and lakhs of parents into EMI traps.

I have been trying my best on all platforms, from one platform they make me run to another one and then to the third one. It's time to put a stop to this. Even after a couple of good articles from The Ken, Morning Context, Forbes are still daring to call us trolls and putting a ban on us. Let's make an example of this scam so that other 'EdTechs' never forget to stay within ethical limits.

## United we stand, divided we fall

Please ACT. Tweet, Write on LinkedIn, Medium, Quora, FB, IG, Reddit whatever. But in the comments, this time, let's talk about your contribution to this cause.

&#x200B;

Thank you

Since today's Karnataka bandh and r/bangalore is going to be a hot spot, I thought of staying at home till evening. So, I bought 4 litres of milk to make homemade Paneer and do some tasty dish.

I cut open the pack with great zest, poured the ice cold milk to the big Milk saucepan, set the flame to high, waited patiently for it to come close to a rolling boil, squeezed the lemon to separate the Whey and milk curds, and voila, I had, in front of me, dancing curds of smoking hot Paneer.

Following the procedure, I strained the Whey and placed the searing Paneer on the Muslin cloth and started to dip in icy water to remove the sourness. I then rolled the cloth, placed a heavy object on it to bring it to a proper shape, and kept it aside and went to take a bath.

Now the Pique:

My grandfather enters the scene, he eats his breakfast, makes himself a cup of coffee, finishes it, and then decides to wash his plate and cup. After doing that, his eyes catches a cloth being rolled and wrapped and being pushed down by a heavy utensil. Curious mind of his starts to investigate and he finds something white, grainy textured, a tad hot 'thing'.

He thought that 'accidentally' someone had placed it there. So, being the gentleman, loving, caring, and helping Grandfather/Father-in-law/Father/ he collects the 'waste' and neatly empties every grain, ounce of it to the drain. I never thought I'd say this, but my efforts literally went down the drain! 

When I found out I was angry and sad. When I asked him, he had this huge smile and a sense of achievement, as, according to him, he had helped. Looking at that, my only thought was the realisation of his actions which were nothing but innocence and having the good sense of helping.

I told him what that 'waste' was, he regretted it badly and apologized profusely. I told him I'll get Paneer from the store and would make him a wonderful dish, his eyes gleamed with happiness and told that he'd assist in cooking.
